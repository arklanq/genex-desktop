# Release readiness

This page records acceptance boundaries, not assignments or a running task journal.
Issues and PRs own current work/status. Update a boundary in place when direct evidence closes
it; link the resulting PR/CI artifact instead of appending another checkpoint here.
The original remaining-work plan and acceptance reports are recoverable from Git history.

## Boundaries requiring direct acceptance

| Boundary | Required proof |
| --- | --- |
| Public plugin distribution | Approved public catalog/artifact destination, source/license review, anonymous discover → install → execute → update with retained settings; see [marketplace release](STUDIO-MARKETPLACE-RELEASE.md) |
| Native Claude/Codex context | Authenticated session-specific measurements, supported context policy, resume/model switch, and separately bounded compaction acceptance; see [connections and context](connections-and-context.md) |
| Fresh Bonsai setup | New UI download/install, cancellation/resume, and first response; existing-runtime inference does not prove fresh installation; see [local models](local-models.md) |
| Fresh-user account/MCP lifecycle | Explicit disconnect/restart/reconnect, denied credential access, connector setup/revocation, and accurate skill scope |
| Asset and first-playable behavior | Retained optimized variants selected through actual manifest data, bounded model-led asset adherence, first-playable timing and incremental preview; fixture coverage does not establish model outcomes |
| Hosted publishing | Attribute cold owner-page startup delays, distinguish uploaded bytes from an initialized playable page, and verify one draft/update without duplicate transactions |
| Combined release | Integration regression plus applicable package/resource checks after release changes settle; component CI totals do not establish full-app readiness |

These are retained unclosed acceptance boundaries from the previous plan, not failures
reproduced by the developer-workflow cleanup. Verify current issue/PR evidence before taking
one on or claiming it is still open. Passing a narrower check does not close a wider boundary.

## Distribution and open source

Status: **Open** needs an owner decision or work not started, **Partial** has work in the tree
but no acceptance, **Done** is in place.

| Boundary | Status | Current state and what closes it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| License | Done | Root [MIT license](../LICENSE), copyright `genex.games`; owner confirmed historical contributor rights. Package and RPM metadata use MIT; third-party terms remain separate |
| Contributor terms | Open | DCO or CLA, described in [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-terms); depends on the license decision |
| Third-party sources | Partial | [Notices](../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) cover copied sources (Exo, orbkit, shadcn/ui), packages without license files and three.js's vendored libraries; the build stops on a gap. The bundled cua-driver (MIT) ships with cua's license and notices; cua publishes no notice list for the crates.io libraries its binary links, so that list is still to produce. Beautiful UI and transitions.dev material was removed or rewritten. Genex UI adaptations use MIT with separate trademark rights. The unlicensed third-party editor reference is excluded from `dev` but still on `main`, in tag `v0.1.0-rc.1` and in history; vendored hosted guide terms and historical publication review remain open |
| Provider terms | Open | Claude runs only on a subscription login through Claude Code. Needs Anthropic's confirmation for a distributed app, or an API-key mode as the default for distributed builds. The Claude Agent SDK in the package is proprietary |
| Repository history | Open | Internal evidence and personal paths in history; publish with full or fresh history. No credentials were found |
| Platforms | Partial | macOS arm64 supported; Intel untested. Linux x64 deb, rpm and zip are built and booted in CI on Ubuntu 22.04, but window controls and a secret store without a keyring are open. Ubuntu 24.04's user-namespace restriction: the deb installs an AppArmor profile for the app and startup shows the setup screen (with the command for the zip) when the sandbox cannot start a process; not yet proven on a 24.04 machine or runner. Windows x64 is being ported: CI makes an unsigned per-user Squirrel installer (`Genex-Setup.exe`) and the setup screen installs the sandbox (one UAC prompt); the sandbox wiring and a clean-machine install are open. The Genex plugin payload leaves out Sentry's bundler plugins so every file stays under 260 characters in an install under a 20-character user name (`plugin-payload-paths.test.ts`) |
| Package contents | Partial | Packaging drops other platforms' node-pty and sandbox-runtime helpers and the Genex CLI's app-level dependency tree (`scripts/package-prune.cjs`), and refuses a symlinked `node_modules`. The packaged smoke checks both and the fuses; it passed 35/35 on an unsigned darwin-arm64 package with fuses applied. Needs the same pass on CI's Linux package and a signed build |
| Signed and notarized builds | Partial | Wired: `osxSign` (hardened runtime, `allow-jit` only, no library-validation exemption; it signs the bundled cua-driver with the app's identity too, while the Windows build ships cua's own signed `cua-driver.exe`) and notarytool with an App Store Connect API key when the release secrets exist; fuses; `release.yml` verifies codesign, spctl and the staple. The Developer ID Application certificate exists (an Individual account, so Gatekeeper shows the developer's personal name). Waiting for: the `.p12` with its password, the API key (`.p8`, key id, issuer id), and the `release` environment secrets. The bundle id is `games.genex.desktop` (the app is Genex); changing it after release resets macOS permissions. Windows is built and tested every release but left out of the draft until it is signed: SignPath (the OSS Foundation program) signs it with the `release-signing` policy once its production certificate is in the organization; until then a Package dispatch with `test_sign` proves the wiring with the test certificate ([release operations](release-operations.md)). Closed by a signed tag build that installs from the draft release on a clean Mac and a clean Windows machine |
| Update channel | Partial | `update-electron-app` (update.electronjs.org, GitHub Releases) is on (`AUTO_UPDATE_ENABLED`) for packaged macOS and Windows builds from the public launch: the service reads only public repositories, skips drafts and pre-releases, and needs signed builds; copies built earlier (every `-rc`) never check. A download shows **Relaunch to update** in the sidebar (asking before it ends an active run); draft upload refuses a release missing the feed's assets for the platforms it distributes (the macOS zip always; RELEASES, the full nupkg and the installer once Windows ships). Linux builds ask GitHub's latest published release every six hours and offer **Download Genex X** (the release page); Settings → About and the app menu check on demand. Closes with an update from one signed release to the next ([release operations](release-operations.md#automatic-updates)) |
| Diagnostics | Partial | In code: a rotating, redacted `<userData>/logs/studio.log` (5 × 5 MB, mode 0600), local-only crash dumps in `<userData>/Crashpad` (no upload), Settings → Harness → Copy diagnostics, an error screen with Reload and Copy error, a crashed renderer reloaded at most twice a minute, and a bounded quit. Bug reports point at the log. Needs acceptance in a fixture UI run and a packaged build |
| CI gating | Partial | Every PR runs Linux static checks, baseline contracts, affected L1 tests and, when a change reaches it, the harness gate (`verify:harness`). macOS fast/package/Windows/terminal workflows retain main-target and dispatch gates; rigs require `full-tests` (a nightly rig is billed macOS time, an owner decision; a schedule must live on `main` and check out `dev`). The added behavior gate needs Linux CI acceptance and branch protection. Release validates source/version before signing, requires full regression plus terminal/gallery checks, and refuses draft distribution without macOS signing (Windows ships only once signed); exact candidate CI, environment reviewers and branch protection remain required |
| Telemetry disclosure | Done | Studio sends no analytics or crash reports. Share build metrics (Settings → Privacy) is an off-by-default opt-in that sends anonymous build rows described in [PRIVACY](../PRIVACY.md); the app never asks for it, and a server 410 pauses it. The Genex CLI's crash reporting is off unless `GENEX_TELEMETRY` is set, where the asset adapter runs it and where the Genex plugin starts it as an MCP server (`genexTelemetryEnv`); Claude Code and Codex follow their vendors' settings (README). The bundled cua-driver runs with its product telemetry and update check off (`DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, `CUA_DRIVER_RS_UPDATE_CHECK=0`; [computer use](computer-use.md#the-persons-computer)) |

## Execution constraints

- Preserve normal profiles, game originals, edited harnesses and existing generated assets.
- Account-connected checks require their explicit opt-in under [verification](agent/verification.md).
  A context read does not authorize a compaction, paid generation or new-build run.
- Use an identified owned profile and check for active user work before restart or UI testing.
- Public hosting, repository visibility, source publication and release promotion require
  their own authorized scope. Curated catalog preparation alone is not publication.
- Keep unresolved checks visible in the relevant PR. Put raw identities/logs locally or in
  selected CI artifacts, following [PR guidance](../AGENTS.md#documentation-and-prs).

## Product decisions retained

The catalog is curated. Keep the public index, immutable plugin artifacts and private app
source separate. Local developer installation remains available; plugins handle their own
service accounts. Broad self-service publishing, billing, ratings, search services, publisher
dashboards, silent updates and wider sandboxing are separate product work.

## Hardening gates

Use Node 24 (`.nvmrc`) and the lockfile. `npm ci` runs `runtime:check`, which validates the actual
pinned Electron independently of external coding installations; no coding CLI is required for npm installation. Binary presence does not prove authentication.
The shared `scripts/electron-runtime.mjs` resolves Electron for developer/test launchers.
`genex.test.ts` invokes the real pinned CLI against a fixture API, covering shared admission and server credit refusal without a Studio allowance,
lost-create recovery, repeated retrieval, credential isolation and account/character approval races.
`genex-delivery.test.ts` covers unsafe destinations. Export checks cover explicit roots, nested
private files, symlinks and module dependency closure. These fixtures spend no live credits.

Live acceptance additionally requires account-holder sign-in/terms, a current affordable quote,
one in-app coding-agent asset request, visible or audible integration, restart/retrieval without
regeneration, independent export and packaged reuse. A downloaded file alone does not pass this
gate. Record total ambiguous as well as accepted paid submissions against the authorized test cap.
The current task allows 100 credits total; that number is not a product default.

Plain-Node rigs must inject fixture providers even when recreating StudioCore to test restart.
Close rigs after each scenario and close the fixture server if initialization fails. A test that
asserts events are absent from Studio must read that specific thread, not listAllEvents. Preserve
routing/termination assertions and diagnose broad-suite failures separately from isolated passes.

Sandbox preparation regressions inject transient lookup failures, inaccessible binaries and
Stop during preparation. The real sandbox suite retains read/write/network denial assertions.
A missing health verdict includes the director tool trace, so failed integration cannot be
misdiagnosed from the final pass list alone.
