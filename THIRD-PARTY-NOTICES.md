# Third-party notices

Genex's own source is licensed under [MIT](LICENSE). These notices preserve the separate
licenses and terms of included third-party software.

## Where notices ship

- Bundled packages: the build writes their notices to `dist/resources/third-party` (`NOTICE.md`
  plus each package's license files), for every npm package bundled into the app's JavaScript or
  compiled into its stylesheet (Tailwind CSS, tw-animate-css, xterm's CSS). A package that ships
  no license file has its section on this page, and the build stops when one has neither. This
  page ships as `PROJECT-SOURCES.md`, beside the root MIT license, and again beside the vendored
  three.js and the Assets viewer's decoders.
- External runtime packages (`node-pty`, `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime`,
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `@xterm/*`, `zod` and their dependencies) keep their license
  files in the packaged `node_modules`.
- Electron supplies its own license and Chromium notices.
- On macOS and Windows, cua-driver (MIT) keeps its license and cua's notices under
  `dist/resources/cua-driver` ([Vendored Cua Driver](#vendored-cua-driver-cua-driver)).
- On Windows, Git for Windows (GPL-2.0 and its components' licenses) keeps its `LICENSE.txt` and
  `usr/share/licenses` under `resources/git`
  ([Bundled Git for Windows](#bundled-git-for-windows)).
- The TypeScript 7 compiler (Apache-2.0), `@types/node` and `undici-types` (MIT) that the
  self-edit type gate runs keep their license and notice files under `dist/resources/tsc`.
- The Genex asset CLI (`@genex-ai/cli-demo`, MIT) and its dependencies keep their license files
  in the Genex plugin payload under `dist/resources/plugins/genex/node_modules`.

## Bundled plugin icons

- `src/plugins/blender/icon.png` (shipped as `dist/resources/plugins/blender/icon.png`) is the
  official Blender mark, as Blender's own app icon shows it. The Blender logo is a registered
  trademark of the Blender Foundation; Local Blender uses it only to identify Blender, which it
  runs (https://www.blender.org/about/logo/). No endorsement is implied.
- `src/plugins/genex/icon.png` is Genex's own icon from genex.games.
- `src/plugins/godot/icon.svg` and the `godot` glyph in `src/renderer/ui/icons.tsx` redraw the
  head of the Godot logo as simplified line art. The Godot logo is by Andrea Calabró, licensed
  under CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/); these drawings change it.
  Godot and the Godot logo are trademarks of the Godot Foundation, used only to identify Godot,
  which the Godot plugin runs. Genex is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Godot Foundation.
- `src/plugins/unreal/icon.svg` and the `unreal` glyph in `src/renderer/ui/icons.tsx` draw a U in
  a ring to identify Unreal Engine, which the Unreal plugin runs. Unreal and Unreal Engine are
  trademarks or registered trademarks of Epic Games, Inc. in the United States and elsewhere.
  Genex is not affiliated with or endorsed by Epic Games.
- `src/plugins/unity/icon.svg`, the `unity` glyph in `src/renderer/ui/icons.tsx` and the project
  tile in `src/plugins/unity/panel.html` show the Unity logo, unaltered (its path from Simple Icons
  13.21.0, CC0-1.0), only to identify Unity, which the Unity plugin runs. Unity and the Unity logo
  are trademarks or registered trademarks of Unity Technologies or its affiliates in the U.S. and
  elsewhere. Genex is not affiliated with or endorsed by Unity Technologies.

## Routed tool marks

`src/renderer/media/tools` holds the marks of the tools Genex routes, as genex.games/tools shows
them, for the Genex plugin's page and picture. Each mark is its owner's trademark (Tripo, Meshy,
Uthana, OpenAI, Google Gemini, MiniMax, the Blender Foundation, ElevenLabs) and only names the
tool Genex sends work to; no endorsement is implied. The Meshy, Gemini, MiniMax, OpenAI and
ElevenLabs marks come from lobe-icons (MIT, below); the light fills are recoloured for a dark
tile. `genex.svg` is Genex's own G, from the startup loader.

## Vendored Genex skills

`src/plugins/genex/skills` (shipped as `dist/resources/plugins/genex/skills`) holds Genex skill
text behind a Studio-written preface; `vendor.json` records each source, version and sha256, and
`npm run genex:skills` refreshes them.

- Eight platform cards and their references, copied unchanged from
  `@genex-ai/cli-demo` 1.36.9 `templates/skills` (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 me-ai-org). The
  license text ships beside them as `skills/LICENSE-cards`, copied from the CLI's `LICENSE`.
- `genex/SKILL.md` wraps https://genex.games/SKILL.md (v1.36.9), which is not part of the npm
  package. It is attributed to Genex here; its license is not yet confirmed (see "Status not yet
  recorded" below).

## Adapted Roblox skill

`src/plugins/roblox/skills/get-started.md` (shipped as
`dist/resources/plugins/roblox/skills/get-started.md`) adapts the `roblox-get-started` skill from
Roblox's [roblox-studio-agent-plugin](https://github.com/Roblox/roblox-studio-agent-plugin)
(plugin version 0.2.1, `skills/roblox-get-started`), MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 Roblox Corporation. It
is rewritten for Genex's Roblox Studio button and keeps the original's license text at its end.
The Roblox Studio plugin's other skills are Genex's own. Roblox and Roblox Studio are trademarks of
Roblox Corporation; Genex is not affiliated with Roblox Corporation.

## Luau checks downloaded on request

The Roblox Studio plugin's **Add Luau checks** downloads these public releases from GitHub, each
pinned by version, size and sha256 (`src/plugins/roblox/luau-tools.ts`), only when the person
confirms it. None of them is in the app's build or this repository; they are kept in the plugin's
own storage (`<plugin storage>/luau/<name>-<version>/`) and run on the person's computer to check a
game's scripts.

- [luau-lsp](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp) 1.70.1 (`luau-lsp-macos.zip`,
  `luau-lsp-win64.zip`), MIT, Copyright (c) 2022 JohnnyMorganz; and its Roblox type definitions
  `scripts/globalTypes.None.d.luau` at the same tag, from the same repository and license.
- [selene](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene) 0.32.0 (`selene-0.32.0-macos.zip`,
  `selene-0.32.0-windows.zip`), Mozilla Public License 2.0. selene fetches Roblox's API library
  itself on its first run.
- [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) 2.6.0 (`stylua-macos-aarch64.zip`,
  `stylua-macos-x86_64.zip`, `stylua-windows-x86_64.zip`), Mozilla Public License 2.0.

Each release ships its own license; Genex neither changes nor redistributes these programs.

## Vendored three.js

Games and the asset preview use a vendored three.js (MIT, Copyright © 2010-2026 three.js
authors); its license ships as `dist/resources/vendor/three-LICENSE`. The copied `examples/jsm`
tree includes third-party libraries under their own terms, listed with their licenses in
[three.js add-on libraries](#threejs-add-on-libraries); the Assets viewer also copies the Draco and
Basis Universal decoders to `dist/renderer/decoders`.

## Vendored Cua Driver (cua-driver)

On macOS and Windows, computer control runs cua-driver 0.35.2 from
[trycua/cua](https://github.com/trycua/cua) (MIT, Copyright (c) 2025 Cua AI, Inc.), bundled as
`dist/resources/cua-driver/cua-driver` (`cua-driver.exe` on Windows): the executable from cua's
release, on macOS thinned to the app's architecture and signed with the app's identity, on Windows
as cua signed it (`scripts/vendor-cua-driver.ts`). Its license and cua's third-party notices for that release
(code derived from trope-cua, Interface-Agent, yabai, QuickJS-ng, rquickjs and T3 Code, all MIT)
ship beside it as `LICENSE.md` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, copied from `build/cua-driver/`. The
bundled copy runs with cua's telemetry and update check turned off.

## Bundled Git for Windows

The Windows app ships Git for Windows 2.56.0.windows.2, the portable edition from
[git-for-windows/git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git), as `resources/git` beside the app:
Git (GPL-2.0) and the MSYS2 and MinGW-w64 programs and libraries it is built with, each under its
own license. Its `LICENSE.txt` and the license files in `usr/share/licenses` ship unchanged with
it. The copy is the release's own files with its documentation, graphical tools, Vim and Git
Credential Manager left out (`scripts/vendor-git-for-windows.ts`); nothing in it is modified. The
source of every part is published with that release on GitHub and in the MSYS2 and Git for Windows
package repositories it names.

## Vendored Genex embed SDK (@genex-ai/embed-sdk)

Template games and published games that bring no SDK of their own use Genex's player-identity SDK,
`@genex-ai/embed-sdk` 0.33.0 (MIT, as its package.json declares; the package ships no license
file). Its browser modules are copied unchanged to `dist/resources/vendor/genex/embed-sdk` and to
`dist/resources/plugins/genex/embed-sdk`, and from there into a published game's
`vendor/genex/embed-sdk`.

## Cover orb shaders from orbkit

`src/shared/cover-orbs.ts` holds twelve fragment shaders and orbkit's shared GLSL helpers, copied
from orbkit (https://github.com/zzzzshawn/orbkit, commit 5dbd641) with `main` renamed and their
parameter and colour defaults kept; Genex wraps them to fill the circle and light the ball. Only
orbkit's MIT-licensed runtime and orbs are included (SHDR-11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 21, 23, 24, 30,
32 and 33); its orbs ported from XorDev's shaders are under non-commercial terms and are not.
The renderer chunk carries the notice below as a legal comment.

## Fonts

Zalando Sans SemiExpanded, Geist and Geist Mono are used as published under the SIL Open Font
License 1.1 (Geist Mono as its Google Fonts Latin subset). Their OFL texts ship beside them in
`dist/renderer/fonts`. Copies with their OFL texts in `design/genex-promo-video/public/fonts` and
`design/play-publish-video/public/fonts` render the promo films.

## Promo films

The films in `src/renderer/media` are made by Genex with Remotion, which is not bundled. The
Genex promo film is made from recordings of genex.games; one clip, `village-game.mp4`, was
generated through fal.ai with Nano Banana Pro and Seedance 2.5 (`design/genex-promo-video/README.md`).
The Play film, `play-publish.mp4`, shows game covers from the public genex.games gallery
(`design/play-publish-video/README.md`); its players and its desk were made with Genex image
generation for the film.

## Components under other terms

- Claude Agent SDK (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`) ships in the package. It is not open
  source: © Anthropic PBC, all rights reserved, used under Anthropic's legal agreements
  (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance). Its native CLI packages are excluded.
- The Blender logo in `src/renderer/ui/brand.tsx` is a trademark of the Blender Foundation, used
  unaltered to refer to Blender under its logo guidelines (https://www.blender.org/about/logo/).
- The X logo in `src/renderer/ui/brand.tsx` is a trademark of X Corp., used unaltered only to name
  X on Post on X, under its brand toolkit (https://about.x.com/en/who-we-are/brand-toolkit).
- The GitHub mark in `src/renderer/ui/brand.tsx` is Primer Octicons' `mark-github` (MIT,
  © GitHub, Inc.) and a trademark of GitHub, Inc., used unaltered only to mark a link to a
  community plugin publisher's GitHub profile (https://github.com/logos).

## Status not yet recorded

These need an owner decision before public distribution; see
[release readiness](docs/release-readiness.md#distribution-and-open-source).

- Genex UI sources: components, theme tokens, the wordmark and the catalog-search engine were
  adapted from the owner's `genex-cli-threejs` web app (`src/renderer/ui/GENEX-SOURCES.md`).
  The owner's contributed adaptations are covered by the root MIT license. Genex's name and
  logo identify the product; the code license does not grant trademark rights.
- The Genex guide https://genex.games/SKILL.md, vendored as `src/plugins/genex/skills/genex`:
  its license and terms are not recorded.
- An unlicensed third-party canvas-editor reference has been excluded from the current tree.
  Its historical copies still need review before repository publication.

## Exo ports

The event store (`src/substrate/event-store.ts`), UUID semantics (`src/substrate/ids.ts`),
event envelope (`src/shared/event-log.ts`), turn rule (`src/substrate/turns.ts`), the guardian's
restart intent (`src/substrate/harness-host.ts`) and turn loop
(`src/harness-seed/loop/turn-loop.ts`) are TypeScript adaptations of Exo. Source: https://github.com/exoharness/exo.

UTIF.js publishes the whole file under MIT and credits none of the following embedded code:

- **JPEG decoder (Apache-2.0).** The minified block after `// Following lines add a JPEG decoder` is pdf.js's `JpegImage` (same DCT constants and `JpegError`, and the file says `//UTIF.JpegDecoder = PDFJS.JpegImage;`). See the pdf.js section.
- **Nikon and Sony ARW raw decoders (dcraw).** `_decodeNikon` (the `nikon_tree` table), `_decodeARW`, `_ljpeg_diff`, `_getbithuff` and `_make_decoder` port dcraw's `nikon_load_raw`, `sony_arw_load_raw`, `ljpeg_diff`, `getbithuff` and `make_decoder`. dcraw.c (Copyright 1997-2018 by Dave Coffin) restricts only its Foveon functions and says "All other code remains free for all uses"; UTIF.js contains no Foveon code.
- **Panasonic RW2 format-6 decoder (LGPL-2.1 OR CDDL-1.0).** `readPageRW6` in `_decodePanasonic` matches LibRaw's `pana_cs6_page_decoder::read_page` line for line (same shifts, masks and `// 14 bit` comments). LibRaw (Copyright 2019-2022 LibRaw LLC) is dual-licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.txt) or the Common Development and Distribution License 1.0 (https://opensource.org/license/cddl-1-0); its source is at https://github.com/LibRaw/LibRaw.
- **GoPro VC-5 decoder.** `_decodeVC5` is minified; its origin is not identified.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
