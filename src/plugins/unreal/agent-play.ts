/**
 * Which play session is the agent's own. The editor lock gives way to the person while they play
 * in Unreal (`editor-activity`, its probe), but the agent starts play sessions too: the editor
 * connector forwards its `StartPIE`. So while a play the agent started runs, the connector keeps a
 * marker (`agent-play.json {startedAt}`) in its own folder, the game's folder in the plugin's
 * storage (`<storage>/mcp/<game>`, the manifest's `cwd: storage:project`), and removes it on the
 * agent's `StopPIE`, when the connector closes and when the editor goes away. The backend reads it
 * there; a marker older than {@link AGENT_PLAY_MAX_MS} is not believed (a connector that died
 * without removing it), and the lock's probe forgets one once it sees the editor play nothing (the
 * agent's play ended some other way: the person pressed Stop, or the game ended play).
 * Residuals: a play the person starts before any probe saw the agent's play end counts as the
 * agent's; a play the agent starts any other way than the connector's `StartPIE` (a script that
 * begins play) counts as the person's, so the agent's own editor calls, its stop of that play
 * included, wait for "the person" until the lock's wait runs out; and the person's edits outside
 * play are not seen at all.
