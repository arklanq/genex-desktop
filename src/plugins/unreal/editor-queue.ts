/**
 * The editor queue: parts written without Unreal go into the one visible editor one at a time —
 * apply the part, play its test, take play shots, stop play — and it hands back what it saw. It
 * waits while Unreal doesn't answer (a crash or a restart is fine) and while the person works in
 * the editor, and it always stops a play session it started. Each play test runs with Unreal's
 * background throttle off, and the queue gives the setting back once play stops. A C++ part's code
 * is copied into the game and the game's module hot-reloaded first, outside play; code that doesn't
 * compile or load ends the part before anything is applied. Accepting or rolling back a part is the
 * caller's (snapshots are the host's).
 *
 * While a part applies and plays, the queue watches the editor for a crash (a part's C++ can crash
 * Unreal as play starts, and the part would stay "playing" while every call timed out): it looks
 * every few seconds and whenever a call fails, and a crash ends the part at once as `crashed`, with
 * Unreal's signal and call stack; nothing more reaches the crashed editor.
 *
 * A play-check is a play in the same queue (the Unreal lead's fallback for save-point thumbnails):
 * nothing is applied, the game is only played — settle, shot spawn, drive the route with frames,
 * shot ride, every check, the probes. Every wait in play counts the play world's own game seconds,
 * with a cap on the queue's clock (a loaded editor can play at 5–9 frames per second, and real-time
 * holds then gave about one second of game time); an older helper without a game clock is given
 * the seconds on the queue's clock.
