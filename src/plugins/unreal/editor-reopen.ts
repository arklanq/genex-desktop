/**
 * Reopening Unreal after it crashed, for the Unreal Loop (a C++ crash can leave the crash reporter
 * open, and a hot reload can point the project's `UnrealEditor.modules` at a library the restored
 * Source no longer matches). `reopen-editor` starts a background job, one per project: it ends what
 * is left of this project's editor and its crash reporter, builds the game's C++ module with
 * UnrealBuildTool when it has one, opens the project (the panel's Open, which waits for a free
 * port) and waits until it answers. `editor-state` says whether the game's Unreal answers, whether
 * this project's editor process runs (an editor busy on its game thread answers nothing for a
 * while, yet hasn't crashed), how reopening goes and where the project's Genex editor helper stands
 * against the plugin's. `end-editor` ends this project's editor and its crash reporter the same way
 * and nothing more, for the Loop's cold restores and planned restarts: the Loop never hot-reloads,
 * and `reopen-editor` does nothing while the editor answers. `end-editor` answers only once the
 * game's Unreal no longer answers, asked again until it says so: the setup remembers a good answer
 * for a few seconds, and a `reopen-editor` or `update-helper` right after must never take that for
 * an open editor.
 *
 * Only this project's own processes are ended: an UnrealEditor whose arguments name its
 * `.uproject`, and Unreal's crash reporter whose arguments name one of its crash folders: a folder
 * directly in the engine's or the project's crash folder, named for the project, not a link, whose
 * copy of the editor's log names this project. Unreal's normal quit goes first, and only while the
 * one editor running is this project's (it reaches whichever editor runs); then a terminate, then a
 * kill. Processes are listed on a Mac, all of them; on Windows only the editors are (WMI, with their
 * command lines), each ended with what it started (`taskkill /T /F`), and the crash reporter, whose
 * crash folders Windows names otherwise, is not looked for. Elsewhere none is ended.
