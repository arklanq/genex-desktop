/**
 * The Unreal plugin's tools for the Unreal Loop. Builders call `check-part` (the gate, no editor).
 * The Loop's runner calls the rest on the game folder: `run-part` puts a part that passes the gate
 * in the editor queue and answers at once, `part-result` reads where it stands (with its play shots
 * once done), `rollback-part` and `reload-level` take a rejected part back out of the editor, and
 * `export-reference` keeps the engine's node reference and Python names for the gate, and has the
 * editor write the template's project file (its game mode, Blueprints and input actions), whose
 * Blueprints the gate and `find-nodes` then know. A C++ part's `check-part` also compiles the
 * builder's copy with UnrealBuildTool in its sandbox (`part-compile.ts`, `ubt-sandbox.ts`), never
 * the game's own folder, whose module the open editor has loaded; `run-part` checks it without
 * compiling and hands the queue its code, which the queue copies into the game and hot-reloads.
 * `cpp-status` and `add-cpp-module` (`cpp-tools.ts`) tell the runner whether C++ compiles here and
 * add the game's C++ module. The queue watches the editor for a crash while a part is in it, and
 * after one the runner has `reopen-editor` and `editor-state` (`editor-reopen.ts`) reopen Unreal.
 *
 * The Unreal lead's save points and restarts have their own tools beside these
 * ({@link LiveLoopToolName}): `play-check` queues a play of the game with the board's checks (read
 * with `part-result`), `save-all` saves the editor's work (ending a play session first, which the
 * helper's save refuses to save under), `log-errors` reads the editor log's new error lines,
 * `end-editor` ends this project's editor for a cold restore, and `update-helper` updates the
 * project's Genex editor helper while Unreal is closed. And ({@link LeadLoopToolName})
 * `editor-activity` says whether a play session runs and how much is unsaved, before any save, and
 * `hero-shots` takes the level's hero cameras' stills for a save point's thumbnails. Agents in a
 * chat open and quit the game's Unreal themselves with `open-editor` and `quit-editor`
 * (`editor-control.ts`), over the same reopen jobs, and read `editor-status`.
