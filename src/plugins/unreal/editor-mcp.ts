/**
 * Studio's bridge to the Unreal Editor's own MCP server: Epic's experimental Unreal MCP (UE 5.8),
 * which the user's editor serves on 127.0.0.1 once its project enables the ModelContextProtocol
 * plugin and starts the server on the project's own port. The bridge finds the editor itself: for
 * every call it reads the project chosen in the panel and the set-up projects with their ports.
 * Once the user has chosen a project, calls go only to that project's editor; a chosen project
 * that is closed or not set up gets a message naming the fix, never another project's editor.
 * A chosen project Genex is starting in Unreal (the toolbar's Starting) is waited for, up to
 * 150 s, and one whose log says its port is blocked gets that message at once.
 * Only with nothing chosen does it use the first set-up project whose editor answers. The answer
 * names the project. Agents get Epic's three meta-tools; every call reaches only
 * local endpoints, in a session of its own, so an editor restarted between calls just answers the
 * next one and no call is ever sent twice. Epic's toolsets return pictures as base64 inside their
 * JSON text, which Studio would truncate as text; the bridge hands them to the agent as images.
 * The Genex editor helper's build and play tools answer a refusal or a failure as `{error}` inside
 * a call Epic counts as done; the bridge hands such an answer to the agent as a failed call.
 * A toolset's description too long for one answer comes back as its tools by name, and the
 * bridge's own `tool_name` reads one tool's (`editor-describe.ts`).
 * An editor behind Genex plays at 3 frames per second while Unreal's "Use Less CPU when in
 * Background" is on, so the bridge turns it off for the editor's current run while a play test
 * runs and gives it back afterwards; Unreal saves nothing, so the user's preference survives.
 * While a call is pending, the bridge reads what the project's editor log gains every second: when
 * Unreal writes a crash there, the call answers at once with Unreal's own text for what failed,
 * instead of waiting out a call no crashed editor will answer. The Genex editor helper's Loop
 * toolset is Genex's own (its editor queue applies, plays and saves through it): an agent's call
 * or description that names it, however spelled, is refused before any editor is reached. While a
 * play the agent started runs, the bridge keeps a marker beside it (`agent-play.ts`), so the
 * editor lock tells the agent's play from the person's: an agent's `StartPIE` the editor took sets
 * it, and its `StopPIE`, the editor crashing under a call and the bridge closing clear it.
