/**
 * How the Unreal plugin's handlers answer at Genex's moments (`context.hook`): the pure builders of
 * `{block, note, pending, images}` and their words, which the person and the lead read as they did
 * when Genex's runner and checkpoint said them itself. A run (`hook.runId`) and a chat answer by
 * different policies:
 *
 * | Handler at its moment | In a run | In a chat |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `save-all` at `checkpoint.before` | not answering, can't tell, a play, or the save refused: block; saved: nothing | a play: block; anything else: a note of what was saved or why not |
 * | `save-all` at `restore.before` | not running: nothing; busy past the wait, or a save that fails or leaves work: block | same |
 * | `end-editor` at `restore.before` | still answering after it ended everything: block | same |
 * | `reopen-editor` at `restore.after`, `crash` | starts reopening (an outdated helper updated while closed): nothing | same, after a restore only when it closed a running Unreal |
 * | `editor-state` at `health` | answers: nothing; reopening, starting, busy or can't tell: pending; reopening failed, port blocked, unlinked or gone: block | same, gone in the chat's words |
 * | `log-errors` at `run.prepare` / `checkpoint.before` | marks the log's end / notes the new errors | same |
 * | `hero-shots` at `checkpoint.after` | the hero cameras' stills as images, their tone as measures | nothing: no stills taken |
 * | `open-for-run` at `run.prepare` | opens Unreal, updates an outdated helper, exports missing facts; block when it can't | — |
 * | `editor-activity` as the lock's probe | no editor: nobody, nothing unsaved; a play counts only when neither the agent nor the queue started it | same |
