/**
 * The Godot plugin's backend. Agents build a Godot game with Godot's own command line, run in
 * Genex's native-job sandbox (`godot-run.ts`): `new-game` makes the game's project from a template,
 * `check` imports it and loads every file so Godot names each problem, `run-scene` plays a scene
 * headless, `screenshot` takes stills, and `class-reference` answers the installed version's API.
 * Genex's moments use the same: a checkpoint notes what the check found, and a run's save points
 * and its reviewer get stills (`hero-shots`). The panel and the toolbar find Godot, make a game
 * and open it in the person's own Godot editor, which Genex never drives.
