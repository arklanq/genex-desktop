/**
 * Genex multiplayer in a Unity game: Genex's Unity package (`com.genex.multiplayer`, copied from
 * the Genex SDK's `sdks/unity`) embedded in the project's `Packages/` folder, the official Colyseus
 * Unity SDK it runs on asked for in `Packages/manifest.json` at the commit the Genex SDK is tested
 * with (Unity fetches it from Colyseus's own repository; Studio ships none of it), and the game's
 * Genex project in `Assets/Resources/GenexSettings.json`, which the game reads with
 * `Resources.Load`. A WebGL build signs in through the published page's own embed SDK
 * (`window.genexEmbed`, which Studio's connect module exposes); a native one through
 * `GenexNativeIdentity` (Play's gateway and ticket, or a guest). Every file is the person's: nothing
 * is written through a link, and a Genex file the person changed is kept beside the new one as
 * `<name>.mine~` (a name Unity never imports).
