 * computer control clicks File › Publish to Roblox in their Studio: Genex hands the game's chat that
 * task through `game.engine.assist`. The person approves every publish: the panel's press, or the
 * card the manifest declares on the agent's `first-publish` and `publish-update`, which the host
 * asks before the plugin runs.
 *
 * - **First publish** (`first-publish`): a place never published (its link has no `remote` ids)
 *   becomes a new game on Roblox under the name the person approved (the Genex game's title unless
 *   they gave another), with Studio's own privacy and settings and an empty description. The task
 *   stops the turn at any age, ID, two-step, terms or payment question, which stay the person's.
 * - **Publish an update** (`publish-update`): a published place, updated.
 *
 * Where Genex can't click (Windows, no driver, the person said no), the answer gives Studio's click
 * path. Afterwards Genex links the game to the published place by itself (`relink.ts`).
