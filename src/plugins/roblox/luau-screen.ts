/**
 * The screen an agent's `execute_luau` code passes before the Roblox Studio connection forwards
 * it. `execute_luau` runs with a plugin's rights, which reach the person's Roblox account: inserting
 * Creator Store assets, uploading, publishing, the internet, and a published game's live data. Each
 * of those goes through a tool that asks the person first, so code that names one of them, or that
 * looks members up by names it builds (the way past a screen of names), is refused with the tool
 * to use instead.
 *
 * The screen reads the code as text and never runs it. It refuses the plain and the disguised
 * ways to these APIs it knows; a name built in a variable and looked up on an instance found by
 * walking the tree still passes, so the asking tools stay the line the person sees, not this screen.
