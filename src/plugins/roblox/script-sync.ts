/**
 * Scripts as files, both ways: a Roblox game's scripts live as `.luau` files under the game's
 * `src/` (named by `script-paths.ts`), and the Genex helper in Studio keeps the place's scripts in
 * step with them. Genex syncs a script's `Source` only; its attributes, tags and everything else
 * stay in the place export.
 *
 * - **The record.** `.genex/roblox.json` holds each script file's hash as of the last time disk and
 *   Studio agreed on it (`scripts`), and the files Genex itself wrote at the game's top (`written`).
 * - **Reconcile.** Each time a game's helper binds, every script is decided three ways, by Studio's
 *   hash, the file's and the record's: whichever side changed since the record wins; a script new
 *   on one side is copied to the other; one deleted on a side that the other left unchanged is
 *   deleted there too (in Studio only while its hash still matches the record). Changed on both
 *   sides, Studio's version stays and the file's goes to `.genex/conflicts/<when>/`, never under
 *   `src/`. An edit always beats a deletion.
 * - **After a restore.** Git put back `src/` and the record together, so the record says nothing of
 *   what Studio changed since: the restored files win. The reconcile then takes Studio's listing as
 *   the record, so each restored file goes to Studio and a script Studio has alone is removed.
 * - **While bound.** A change under `src/` (a watcher, quiet for {@link SYNC_DEBOUNCE_MS}) is pushed
 *   with the record's hash as the base, so the helper refuses it when Studio changed meanwhile, and
 *   the same conflict rule applies. A script Studio changes (`scripts.changed`) is written to its
 *   file. Echoes are dropped by hash: a write is recorded before it lands, so the change it causes
 *   on the other side matches the record.
 * - **What is skipped.** Scripts Studio's Script Sync keeps in files of its own (listed as synced)
 *   are skipped both ways. A `default.project.json` at the game's top that Genex didn't write is the
 *   person's Rojo project: Rojo keeps their scripts in step, so Genex writes no script either way.
 *   A `src/` that is a link is refused, and nothing is read or written. Every write stays inside
 *   the game folder by real path; a link anywhere on the way is refused and nothing is written
 *   through it.
