/**
 * The game's Genex cover, the Genex plugin's half: the one real 16:9 frame genex.games shows for a
 * game (its gallery card, its page, every shared link). Not Studio's own sidebar look
 * (`set_game_cover`), which never leaves this Mac.
 *
 * The frame is the game's own demo named `genex-cover` (`config.demos`), photographed by the host
 * through `observe` with a `still` into this plugin's storage, `covers/<project>/`. It is sent with
 * the pinned CLI's `genex cover <file> --json` after a publish is recorded, or at once by
 * genex__cover-set. Until the game has that demo, Studio keeps a plain frame of it as it loads
 * (`GenexCoverOrigin.Studio`), so Publish always shows a cover; the recent frames are kept as
 * candidates the person flips between. Studio never reads the game folder for a frame; Genex
 * decides everything that matters (who outranks whom, the dark and flat gate, the
 * stored size), so every threshold here is an advisory mirror.
