# Genex items in AI Game Studio

You are building inside AI Game Studio. Below the upstream marker is Genex's items card, unchanged.
Where it disagrees with this preface, this preface wins.

- **Nex is Genex's currency.** Players buy Nex with real money and spend it in the Genex store.
  The card below still calls it coin.
- **A price in Nex is a store item, listed by default.** When the person prices something in Nex
  (a class, a skin, a weapon, a power-up), or asks to sell something for real money without naming
  a currency, each priced thing is a store item. List it first, with `shop add` and without asking,
  as soon as you know its name and price, so its card shows in the chat: before the SDK, the
  purchase flow or multiplayer, and before or after the game is published, because the card needs
  nothing from the game. Then build it in and wire `buy()` and `getEntitlements()`. In a Loop the
  lead lists the items itself at the start, and store items never wait on a multiplayer part. A
  free thing needs no item. Take each price from the store's grid:
  `genex__cli {"command":"shop list"}` prints it once the game is on Genex, and the default grid is
  100, 300, 800, 1,200, 5,000, 20,000 and 50,000 Nex (0 is Free). Use the grid price nearest the
  one the person named and say which.
- **Coins, gold or gems are the game's own.** A price in coins or any other name is a currency the
  game keeps itself, earned by playing: build it with no store item. Only when the person also says
  that currency is for real money, ask once whether they mean Nex, and write the answer in NOTES.md.
- Studio runs the Genex CLI for you; never run `npx genex`. `genex shop add "<name>" … --json` is
  `genex__cli {"command":"shop add","args":"<name>","options":{…}}` with the flags by name:
  `price` (0 is Free), `type`, `description`, `tag` (a list), `shared` (true or false), and
  `image`, `model` and `package`, each a path inside this game, such as
  `".genex/scratch/frost-axe.png"`. Studio copies those files in itself and adds `--json`. It asks
  the person nothing, because a draft spends nothing and sells nothing; the card's **Put on sale**
  is their decision. `genex shop set <id>` takes the same options plus `rename`, through
  `genex__cli-paid`, which the person approves.
- When the draft comes back, Studio draws its card in the chat after your reply, with **Put on
  sale** and "Other games can use it". `genex shop publish` and `unpublish` are not available:
  only the person puts an item on sale, from that card or Create › Items. Say it is ready and that
  they can ask for changes.
- In a game that is not on Genex yet, `shop add` keeps the item as a local draft in
  `.genex/items/` (its id starts `local_`; `shop set|remove <local id>` change it). Leave those
  files to the CLI: Studio carries them. Its card offers **Sell when published**; after the game's
  publish Studio uploads the drafts itself and puts on sale only what the person approved, unchanged.
  `genex shop sync` is Studio's, not yours.
- `genex items search "<words>"` is `genex__cli {"command":"items search","args":"<words>"}` (and
  `"options":{"tag":["fire"]}`), `genex items list` is `genex__cli {"command":"items list"}`, and
  `genex items add <id>` and `genex items remove <id>` are `genex__cli-paid` with the id in `args`:
  the person approves them, because they change what this game sells. After `items add`, Studio
  writes `genex-items/<id>/` into this game; read it from there.
- Render the picture with the game's own code (the item alone, on a transparent background) and
  save the PNG under `.genex/scratch/`, which Studio never publishes.
- Studio's `@genex-ai/embed-sdk` may not export `ItemState` or report `already_owned` yet: compare
  `item.state === "draft"`, and read `getEntitlements()` again after any `buy()`, whatever it said.
- Studio's preview runs in local test mode with no store: check the cards and the delivery code
  there, then try buying on the published draft (`genex__publish {"operation":"draft"}`). An added
  item reaches this game's store with its next publish (`genex__publish {"operation":"gallery"}`).
