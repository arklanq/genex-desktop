/**
 * A finished build reopened. After a build its lead led as the chat's own session has
 * finished (after-loop-run.ts), a message with Loop on that asks for more work reopens the SAME run — its
 * runId, plan, workers and Builds graph — with the working time the Loop gives it, led again by that
 * same session (director/lead-session.ts). The session decides from the message and records
 * `reopen_run`; once its reply has ended the chat rewrites the run's journal (director/reopen.ts
 * `reopenedJournal`), records the ask on the run, and starts it again as a resume that hears the chat
 * from the ask on (`RunStart.reopen`). Only an explicit start over launches a new build. A question is
 * answered. A paused build is not this: it resumes with the time it had left (`resume_run`).
 *
 * A finished build the run's coordinator answers for (its lead was a session of its own, the
 * message went to another engine, or a kept older part hands the chat to it) reopens the same way when a Loop came with the message: the
 * coordinator is told, and its continue_build reopens the build instead of handing the work to one
 * builder turn (`finishedLoopRun`), with the models the build was made with. A finished build no Loop
 * can go on from — no lead seated, a coordinator on a model without sessions, a kept older part — is
 * answered as with Loop off, and the chat says so once (`firstLoopUnused`). A game built in Unreal is
 * neither: its finished Unreal Loop is never reopened, and the person's Loop message after it may
 * start the next one (chat-dispatch.ts `startsNextUnrealLoop`).
 *
 * chat-dispatch.ts offers it only when every part it depends on says so (`servesReopen`): a seed
 * upgrade keeps a part the agent edited before, which would plan on the commission's model, bridge
 * the launch, word the old rules or read the reopened run's inbox from its start — then the message
 * is answered as with Loop off. This module imports only names every older seed exported
 * (tests/fixtures/seed-exports-pre-reopen.json).
