/**
 * Evidence — how the harness looks at a build.

 * One pass (`gatherEvidence`): load the build, wait for it to say it is up, replay the requested
 * state, prove the studio owns the clock, drive the game's own controls, photograph every camera
 * and the player's eyes, run its demos, and read the state, the console and the GPU. Every mode
 * uses it — the classic gauntlet, the pipeline's base and facets, a spike, the director's judge,
 * health and close passes.
 *
 * Around the pass: the one classifier of why a pass came back unjudgeable (the camera, the clock,
 * or the build), the patience that follows from it (`withObservationPatience`, `patientEvidence`),
 * and the preview windows a look is taken through (`acquireWindow`, `withLease`).
 *
 * This moved here out of gauntlet.ts and director.ts; gauntlet.ts still exports every name it
 * exported, so a harness file the in-app agent edited before the move keeps its imports.

 *    qualifies, exactly as worded, and only while readiness itself went unmeasured (see
 *    `classifyEvidenceFailure`). "evidence pass failed" is deliberately absent: it is the
 *    catch-all for a dead preview, and it must cost its iteration rather than be retried three

 *    build fine seconds later. A pass that took no frame at all has never been one of these.
