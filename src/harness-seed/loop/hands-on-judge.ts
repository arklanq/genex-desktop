/**
 * The judge that plays. A fresh, blind session with only the `computer` tool, on a seeded stepped
 * clock, sent into a build to answer a few yes/no questions by playing — and, given a quest, to
 * reach a goal the studio checks in the game's own state after every move.
 *
 * What makes its "yes" worth more than a playtester's: a quest is set for ONE question (its
 * `checkId`, or the only question asked). That question's yes stands only when the studio verified
 * the goal (`trace.reachedAt`) and the frame the judge cites for it was taken at or after that move
 * and is not blank — read from the frame file itself, never from the words of a tool answer. A yes
 * without that is incomplete. Every other answer of the session is the model's word, ruled as a
 * playtester's is. No window is no measurement, never a failure.
 *
 * Two transports, like the playtester's: a session engine is delegated with a `judge` grant; a
 * direct engine plays through `preview.computer` in the harness's own loop (computer-loop.ts).
 *
 * A new module: it reaches playtester.ts through a namespace import with a local fallback, so a
 * kept older playtester.ts the agent edited never stops it loading.
