/**
 * The art director's one absolute question about one build: would you ship this as the user's
 * demo today? Every other judge compares — a round against the build before it, the integration
 * against the start — so a run could win round after round and never be asked whether it was
 * good. This one sees the whole game: every frame the evidence pass took of a camera the game
 * registered, the player's eyes and each demo's end, then the motion strip and the reference, and
 * answers ship or not with each defect typed to the plan part that owns it (`part`, kept only when
 * it is one of the parts it was given — membership, never words) and how much it matters. It also
 * names what already works and must stay (`doNotRegress`), which every builder and its taste
 * judge are then held to.
 *
 * It asks through the same judge plumbing as every other judge (judge.ts `askJudgeFor`: retries,
 * the fallback engine, the evaluation pin, the judge's record), with the workspace's own rubric
 * (`judge/ship-review.md`) or the built-in one. An answer nobody can read is no verdict — never a
 * "no". A new module: judge.ts is read by namespace, so a kept older judge.ts never stops it linking.
