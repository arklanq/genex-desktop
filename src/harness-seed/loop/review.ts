 * Teeth, without a blade (WP1b): a file outside ownership is left alone when its content arrived
 * by merge (it matches an integration head), reverted to the diff base when it exists there, left
 * alone when it is new and an integration head holds it, and quarantined (never deleted) when it
 * is genuinely new. While a merge is still open the revert takes the merged head's copy, never the
 * pre-merge incumbent's. Findings are chosen by their ownership category. `git(command)` runs a
 * shell command in the worktree and returns its stdout.
