/**
 * Provider outages are weather, not verdicts.
 *
 * A provider that answers "API Error: 529 Overloaded" or "500 Internal server error" for a few
 * minutes fails every facet, the integration facet, the ledger and the global judge at once. Read
 * as "the challenger did not produce a judgeable build", two failures with the same cause trip the
 * circuit breaker on every facet — a policy written for builds that crash, applied to an API that
 * was briefly down.
 *
 * `isTransientProviderError` tells the two apart; `withProviderPatience` waits it out with a
 * capped backoff (about half an hour in total) before the caller's own policy takes over. A
 * usage or auth failure is never transient: those have a sign-in button or a reset time.
