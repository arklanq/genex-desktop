/**
 * Git, the one way the harness speaks it.
 *
 * Every git command line the loop hands to `run.exec` (which runs it with `/bin/sh -c`) is built
 * here, from data: a commit is checked by `commitArg` before it reaches a command line, a message,
 * a path or a model-written reason reaches it through `shellQuote`, and a ref is one of the
 * studio's own (`repo.ts`, `refs/studio/…`). There used to be four copies of the helper that
 * runs them — the director's, the classic pipeline's, a facet's and a spike's — and they had
 * drifted apart in their timeouts, their trimming and what their failures said.
 *
 * Two layers:
 *  - `GIT`, the command lines themselves, pure: for code that already has its own exec (the
 *    union merge, the reviewer, the nested-repository check), and for the tests.
 *  - the helpers that run them through `ctx.call("run.exec")` in a worktree (`cwd`) or in the
 *    live game folder (`{ project }`): `gitAt`, `headOf`, `isAncestor`, `commitAll`,
 *    `updateRef`, `mergeNoFf`, `landIntegration`, `resetClean`, `gitlinks`. A sub-agent's delivery
 *    runs its command lines (`GIT.addFolder`, `GIT.treeEntries`, `GIT.checkoutPaths`) from a module
 *    of its own (`git-delivery.ts`), so a kept older copy of this file still loads beside it.
