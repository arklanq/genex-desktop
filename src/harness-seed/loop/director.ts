/**
 * The director — the run as one agent's decisions, not a program's phases.
 *
 * Before this, a run was a fixed pipeline: scout → planner → base → N facet loops → merge →
 * ledger → integration facet → land. The pipeline never looked at the game; the loops decided
 * everything by rule (fair share, spikes, replans), and the one model that saw the whole run
 * — the planner — saw it once, before anything was built. Runs built the wrong map, split one
 * scene six ways and blamed one facet for another's regression, because no one was in charge.
 *
 * Now one delegated session — the director — runs the run in the run's integration worktree
 * with the computer tool on a window of its own and the harness's machinery as tools:
 *
 *   plan           the run's plan, in the user's chat, before the first worker
 *   goal_update    a required goal's external blocker, or its one replan after two attempts
 *   worker_start   a builder in a worktree of its own — a judged facet loop, or one session
 *   worker_status / worker_steer / worker_stop
 *   judge          evidence + checks + a blind verdict on any build of the run
 *   playtest       a playtester session on any build
 *   integrate      merge a worker's accepted commit into the integration worktree (+ a health pass)
 *   show           offer a build to the user's Live (its Reload plays it)
 *   look           point the director's own window at a build (computer/capture follow it)
 *   note           a decision card in the run's feed
 *   finish         land the integration branch in the live folder and close the run
 *
 * The tools live here, in the harness process (it owns the loops, the judges and the merge);
 * the studio hosts the session and forwards each call through a dispatch that answers
 * (`director_tool`). The old pipeline (autopilot.ts) stays for direct engines, which cannot
 * hold a session, and as `run.classic`.
 *
 * The session is driven by the wake loop (director/wake.ts): the director ends its turn after
 * each decision and the studio wakes the same session with a digest when something happens.
 * The long turn it replaced — `wait` in a loop, a continuation prompt whenever the turn ended
 * with time left, one wrap-up — stays behind `run.directorLoop: "turn"` for one release.
 *
 * On the wake loop the lead IS its chat's own session (one session, director/lead-session.ts): it
 * sits in the game folder and builds with its own hands in the integration worktree it leads, by
 * its full path, committing there beside the workers it hands parallel parts to — a merge conflict
 * goes to a worker of its own — and the chat goes on in the same session after the close. The long
 * turn keeps a separate director whose cwd is the integration worktree.
