/**
 * The art director's part of a run: one absolute look at the whole integrated game
 * (loop/ship-review.ts), the defects it names routed to the parts that own them, and the finish
 * mark that makes the look happen without the lead asking.
 *
 * Every judge of a run compared — a round against the one before, integration against the
 * start — and a run could win thirty rounds that way while nobody asked whether the game was
 * good. At the finish mark (a timed build's last 30% of working time, `finishMarkMs`; a goal build
 * once, when its lead idles or finishes with no review on its head) the studio asks: would you
 * ship this as the user's demo today? The lead is woken with the answer and the defects by part,
 * and from there the owners finish their parts (`stage=finish`). Each defect is a question on its
 * owner's board in the director's name, so its fix keeps the round (a strong flip). The verdict
 * is reported, never a landing veto, and it turns a goal build's finish back at most once.
 *
 * Nor does the look wait for the mark: busy workers can keep a lead from ever idling, and nobody
 * would look at the whole game for hours. So the studio also looks on its own while
 * loop workers build (`shipLookAt`): once the first wave is in (every running loop worker has
 * kept work merged, or after `SHIP_LOOK_EVERY_MS` of working time), then every `SHIP_LOOK_EVERY_MS`
 * on a head it has not reviewed — never within `SHIP_LOOK_GAP_MS` before a timed build's mark,
 * whose own look takes its place. That regular look only routes defects: owners keep building,
 * and the finish stage still begins at the mark. Each review also names what already works and
 * must stay (`doNotRegress`): the latest list rides in every loop worker's spec, so its brief and
 * its taste judge hold the build to it.
 *
 * A new module, bound onto the run (director.ts `LOOP_RUN_MODULES`): callers in older modules reach
 * it through the run and check that it is there. It reads budgets.ts and rules.ts by namespace,
 * so a kept older copy of either never stops it linking.
