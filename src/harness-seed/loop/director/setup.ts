 * A new game is an empty scaffold: no camera can photograph it, the fork gate refuses every
 * worker forked from it, and every judge answers "renders effectively black". The classic
 * pipeline always built a shared base before the facets forked; a director's run gets the
 * same stage — one builder session in the run's own integration worktree, one look allowed to
 * accept blank pixels, one commit — so its first worker forks from something that runs and
 * its first judge has something to look at. (The first director run spent twelve minutes
 * with the director writing the world by hand, unjudged, because no worker could start.)
