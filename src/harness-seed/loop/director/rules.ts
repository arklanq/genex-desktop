 * state the fork point actually reports (`base`, cached by whoever last looked at that commit).
 *
 * The dry run is the difference between a contract and a wish. The first director run wrote
 * thirteen probes over `state.<facet>.<field>`, started five workers on them and read
 * `missing: …` on every board for six hours. Here a path the build does not report comes back
 * as `unsatisfiable` with the keys it does have, and rides into the builder's brief as a note.
 * Nothing is refused for it: a path the build must start reporting is a legitimate contract,
 * and a fork nobody has looked at yet simply reports `notVerified`.
 *
 * `rarelyMeasurable` is the other half of the same warning, and it comes from the game's own
 * ledger rather than from one commit: a check that came back unmeasured on three or more rounds
 * of this kind of game has never told anybody anything, whatever the fork point happens to
 * report today. It is a warning, never a refusal — the honest fix is the director's.
