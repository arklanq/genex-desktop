/**
 * The run's record in its run journal (`autopilot_<runId>`, the harness's own and durable):
 * everything a run needs to go on after a restart, a crash or a pause, and not only in the
 * harness's memory — the run's own clock; each worker's brief, seam, deadline, rounds and last
 * commit; the defects nobody owns; the plan and its review window; the integration's health; the
 * log and how much of it the lead has heard; and the wake loop's own state.
 *
 * Every save writes it (`recordLoopRun`, called by loop-run.ts `saveJournal`). A resumed run reads it
 * back (`restoreLoopRun`, called by setup.ts `prepareLoopRun`), and its lead's first message is a
 * digest built from it (wake.ts). The journal counts the time the run has worked, and a Resume
 * goes on with what the budget has left (`loopRunClock`): every Resume used to start the whole
 * budget again, so a run paused twice could run three times as long as the user gave it; and a
 * resumed lead knew nothing of its workers but their names.
 *
 * Its functions take the run explicitly; they are not bound onto it. It imports only names the
 * seed exported before it existed (tests/fixtures/seed-exports-pre-journal.json), and names from
 * modules newer than it (director/reopen.ts, loop/ship-review.ts): a seed upgrade keeps a module the
 * agent edited, and a name newer than that copy would not link.
