/**
 * A finished build reopened, as the run reads it. After a build whose run seated a lead has
 * finished, a message with Loop on that asks for more reopens the SAME run (the chat's side is
 * loop/reopen-run.ts): the chat rewrites the run's journal (`reopenedJournal`) and starts the run
 * again as a resume. The rewrite drops what a new run starts afresh — its clock, so it works the
 * Loop's new budget; its wake state, so it is not wrapped up for having been asked what next; the
 * last health pass, taken on a head it may no longer stand on; its verified checkpoints and progress
 * review — records its required outcomes as waiting for the lead's plan for the ask (`goals: null`),
 * and marks the journal (`director.reopened`). A kept older setup.ts, journal.ts or wake.ts from
 * before outcomes were kept reads those fields as a new run's.
 *
 * The run reads the mark for where it forks (`reopenCommits`, setup.ts) and for its words: the
 * first digest's heading, the resume note, and the workers "of the finished build" rather than
 * "from before the pause" (reopen-prompts.ts). Its functions take plain facts or the run; they
 * are not bound onto it. It imports only names every older seed exported
 * (tests/fixtures/seed-exports-pre-reopen.json).
