/**
 * The line a run's lead takes the chat on while its build runs (live chat). The chat's queue
 * hands the lead a message the person sends (loop/live-chat.ts) instead of holding it until the
 * run is over, and the lead's own loop hears it (wake.ts): at once in a turn under way, or as the
 * reason for its next wake. What the lead heard is recorded on the run's log, so a later run of
 * the run never tells it again (run-inbox.ts). What it never heard when its run ends goes back to
 * the chat, where it waits for a turn of its own — so Stop still hands over to it.
 *
 * A module of its own, importing only leaves: the director (director.ts), the wake loop and the
 * chat's queue all read it, and a seed upgrade keeps an older copy of any of them the agent edited,
 * which never exported it. A run whose director.ts predates live chat opens no line, and the
 * chat's messages wait for it as they always did.
