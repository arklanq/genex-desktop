/**
 * Vision escalation: a screenshot question the picture judge could not answer (unmeasured) or
 * answered at less than even confidence may be put to a judge that plays — one hands-on probe per
 * build per pass, on the pass's leased window, within a budget for the whole run that the run's
 * journal carries across a restart (probe-count.ts).
 *
 * The probe is a second witness, never a higher court, and it plays without a goal the studio
 * checks, so what it says is the model's word:
 * - it may resolve an unmeasured or low-confidence answer, recorded as the model's word and below
 *   the confidence a measured answer needs, so nothing downstream takes it for a confident one;
 * - it never overturns a confident screenshot answer on its own;
 * - when it flips a measured verdict, the picture judge is asked once more about the frames the
 *   probe cited, and the flip stands only if that look agrees with confidence.
 *
 * A new module: facet scoring calls it through a namespace import, so a kept older scoring never
 * needs it and this one never stops it loading.
