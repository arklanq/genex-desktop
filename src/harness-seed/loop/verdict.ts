/**
 * The verdict record — one per judged build, whoever judged it.
 *
 * Five passes look at a build over a run and, until this module, each wrote its answer in its
 * own shape and its own words: the worker loop kept `verdictSource` + a scoreboard on
 * `facet_iteration`; the lead's judge, fork gate, health pass and close wrote `verdict.json`
 * files and in-memory notes nothing on screen could read. So the app's own build-health box was
 * boilerplate ("Inspect the final result and recorded checks"), a round card counted the checks
 * the judge had *grown* as wins, and the morning could not say, in one sentence, why anything
 * was kept.
 *
 * `verdictRecord()` is the one shape all five produce:
 *
 *   { pass, at, build, against, observed, measured, seen, decision, because }
 *
 * `decision` is a token pair (`kept` and the `rule` that decided it) and `because` is the
 * sentence a non-technical owner reads. The sentence is composed here, from the record's own
 * facts, and never carries a check id, a commit, a branch or a harness word — the screen may
 * show it as it stands. Nothing in this file talks to the studio: it takes plain values and
 * returns a plain object, so every path can be tested without a run.
