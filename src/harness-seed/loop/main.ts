/**
 * The studio harness — layer 2 of the pie (PLAN.md §3, §5).
 *
 * **This file is the agent's own code.** It lives in a git-snapshotted workspace, it can rewrite
 * every line of itself, and the only fixed points below it are the substrate RPC and the
 * bootstrap that imports this module. If an edit here is broken, the process fails to load and
 * the watchdog rewinds the workspace — which is exactly why editing it is safe to allow.
 *
 * Entry point contract expected by the bootstrap:
 *   createStudio(host) -> { dispatch(action), healthcheck(), status(), shutdown() }
 *
 * The work lives beside it: a user message in chat-dispatch.ts, a run in run-dispatch.ts, the
 * boot notice in boot-notice.ts. This file keeps the loop's state, its status lines and the
 * dispatch that routes each action.
