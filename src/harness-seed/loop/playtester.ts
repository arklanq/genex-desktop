/**
 * The playtester — HARNESS-REWORK.md §4.3, §4.7. A fresh-context agent of the run's own model
 * that is handed the controls of the build under test for a bounded session, then answers the
 * facet's `play` checks ("could you find the bench?", "does the swing feel weighty?") and
 * writes a short play report. It is the most expensive evidence there is, so the loop runs it
 * only for facets with play checks and always on the integrated build.
 *
 * Two transports, one rubric (`judge/playtester.md`, frozen):
 *  - a delegated engine (Claude Code) gets the preview as live MCP tools bound to a pooled port
 *    and a read-only session — it can look and press, never edit;
 *  - a direct engine (Ollama) drives the same tools through a small in-memory tool loop here.
