/**
 * How a message sent while the chat's turn works joins that turn (steer). Most join as words: read
 * at the session's next step. One that changes how the turn runs — another engine, model or effort,
 * the Loop switched on or off or its hours, roles or plan review changed, a new mood board, or a
 * slash command — joins as a switch: the session is cut at its next step and the turn goes on with
 * that message's settings (chat-steer.ts), which only a runner that says it can take switches does.
 * A fresh build asked for and Studio's own chat never join.
 *
 * A module of its own: the queue (message-queue.ts) and the turn's runners read it, and a seed
 * upgrade keeps an older copy of any of those the agent edited, which never exported these names.
