 * goes to that same session, in the game folder, with its hands back, instead of to a separate
 * read-only coordinator. It answers, and does the work it is asked for itself; it keeps the run's
 * controls as tools: `run_status`, `show_build` and `land_build` answered live by the host
 * (`runControls`), and after a paused run `resume_run`, bridged in and recorded, which the studio
 * does once the reply ends — the resumed run's lead is this same session, so it may not run while
 * the session still answers. After a finished run with Loop on it may record `reopen_run` instead,
 * and the chat reopens that same run once the reply ends (reopen-run.ts).
 *
 * The coordinator (coordinator.ts) still answers after the long turn (`directorLoop: "turn"`), the
 * classic pipeline, a kept director.ts or part that seats no lead, a lead that was a session of its
 * own, and a message on another engine than the lead's — and whenever a kept chat runner, turn or
 * brief does not serve this (`servesAfterLoopRun`). After a finished run that seated a lead, a
 * message with Loop on lets that coordinator's continue_build reopen the same run once its reply
 * ends, when it answers in a session (reopen-run.ts `finishedLoopRun`).
