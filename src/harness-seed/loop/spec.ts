/**
 * Facet specs — the typed contract a planner emits per facet (HARNESS-REWORK.md §4.1).
 *
 * A spec keeps the prose brief as `intent` and adds what the old brief only implied: which
 * files the facet owns, its ranked identity features, the cameras the judge must look
 * through, and a list of checks the harness (or a one-question judge) can evaluate. The
 * harness validates a spec before a facet starts — unknown kinds, expressions that do not
 * parse, a vision check without a camera — so the planner is asked again instead of a run
 * being spent on a contract nobody can verify.
 *
 * The check catalogue (`library/checks.json`) is the reusable half: checks that earned their
 * keep in past runs, keyed by id, rendered into the planner's prompt so thresholds are reused
 * instead of reinvented. Duplicates are impossible by construction.
