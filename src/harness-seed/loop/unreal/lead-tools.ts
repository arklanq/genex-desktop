/**
 * The Unreal lead's run tools, as its engine sees them (`LEAD_TOOLS`, flat string properties — both
 * bridges) and as the harness answers them: the studio's `director_tool` dispatch forwards each call
 * to the handler the run registers under its id (director/tool-specs.ts `directors`). `run_status`
 * and `note` are the director's own; the worker tools are Genex's one worker model (lead-workers.ts:
 * typed workers are agents.ts's, generic ones the run's shared pool's), the critic critic.ts's, and a
 * save point save-point.ts's. A rewind and a rebuild wait for the end of the lead's turn.
