/**
 * One turn of the Unreal lead: a delegation of its session in the game folder with the lead's run
 * tools (the director grant) and no window, resumed in the same session turn after turn; the first
 * opens with the brief, every later one with a digest. While a turn runs, the harness watches it:
 * the owner's words are steered at once, a finished sub-agent's news and a job of the run that
 * ended too (one no steer reached rides the next digest), a save is asked for after
 * `SAVE_STEER_MS` of work since the last save point, a crash (Genex's health check blocked) is
 * recovered and the lead told what may be lost, the wrap-up is asked for near the end, and the
 * owner's finish ends the turn. Genex's turn moments run around each turn (`turn.start` may stop
 * it). A lost or full session hands the run to a fresh one; a rate limit is waited out, a usage cap
 * pauses the run.
