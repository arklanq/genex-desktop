/**
 * The Unreal lead's run as one object (`Lead`), and the journal it resumes from. The journal is the
 * part a pause keeps (lead-contract.ts `LeadJournal`): the lead's seat and session, its milestones,
 * save points, sub-agents, the critic's advice, what the next digest owes it, credits and cost, and
 * the time worked. It is saved under the run's shared journal artifact (`autopilot_<runId>`), where
 * the app's Resume, its boot repair and `resumeRun` find a run, and tells itself apart from the
 * other modes' journals by its `kind`. The rest of `Lead` is this process's: the clock, the
 * deadlines, the turn under way, the sub-agents at work.
