/**
 * What the Unreal lead's run does with the editor outside the lead's own work, always cold: a
 * crash (Genex's health check blocked) runs Genex's crash moment, at which the plugin reopens
 * Unreal in place, and waits until health is quiet (twice at most); when it won't come back, the
 * game goes back to the last save point, never when Genex held the crash moment back (nothing was
 * tried in place, so the run halts, keeps the work and says Unreal crashed), and never after a Stop
 * (nothing is recorded or said). Between turns, a turn that left unsaved work and no save
 * point gets an autosave, then the lead's rewind or rebuild runs, then the game's C++ module a C++
 * agent asked for is added. What the lead should know of it is carried into its next digest. A run
 * whose Unreal can't be closed or reopened halts with why, in the words the plugin's steps gave.
