 * the game folder (`snapshot.restore`), around which the plugins that are on run their steps (the
 * Unreal plugin saves the editor's work unless it is gone, waiting while it is busy, ends it before
 * the files change, and reopens it after, building the game's C++ module first); a restart is the
 * same moments without the restore (`hooks.fire`). A step that blocks before (work that couldn't be
 * saved: Unreal stays open; Unreal that couldn't be closed) stops it, and nothing is restored. Then
 * the runner waits until Genex's health check is quiet. `sourceStamp` is what Unreal was last built
 * from.
