/**
 * The lead's typed workers: small purpose-built agents (lead-contract.ts `AgentKind`, the worker
 * types the plugins that are on declare) that each run one delegated build turn in a copy of the
 * game folder, as workers of the run (the delegation's `worker`, so the host seats them in the mode
 * of the run's chat), offered only their kind's plugin tools
 * (`AGENT_TOOL_ALLOW`, the delegation's `toolAllow`) and attributed to the run and their part (the
 * delegation's `attribution`), so what they make lands on their own node in the Builds graph. A
 * sub-agent never touches the editor. It delivers into `assets/agents/<id>/` with a manifest; when
 * its turn ends the harness lands that folder in the game folder — only its regular files, inside
 * the folder and within the caps, never a link, a submodule, a climb out or another agent's files —
 * and the lead hears its news until it marks it used or rejected. A turn that ended early still
 * lands a delivery whose manifest was written. Delivered files are never removed at the close.
