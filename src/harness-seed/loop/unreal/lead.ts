/**
 * The Unreal Loop's lead: ONE session builds the whole game in the user's visible Unreal editor and
 * judges its own captures. The run prepares (C++ status, then Genex's run start, at which the
 * plugins that are on open what the game needs, and the template's facts), seats a fresh lead
 * session by default, and then works in turns of
 * at most `TURN_MS`, resumed in the same session: the first opens with the brief, every later one
 * with a digest (time left, the owner's words, finished sub-agents, the last save point, the
 * critic's advice). Mid-turn the harness steers the owner's words at once, a finished sub-agent's
 * news, a save after `SAVE_STEER_MS` without one, a crash and its reopen, and the wrap-up at the
 * soft deadline (`lead-turn.ts`). Between turns it saves what the lead left unsaved
 * (`lead-between.ts`); at the end it settles the sub-agents (keeping every delivered file), fires
 * Genex's run end and closes the run. The Builds graph reads it as a director's run (`lead-graph.ts`).
 * The runner never names a plugin's steps: what the editor does at each moment is the plugin's
 * (`../hooks.ts`); only the C++ module's own tools are called by name.
