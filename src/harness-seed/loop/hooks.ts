 * Genex's moments, as the harness announces them and asks for them. At a moment (a run starting,
 * a turn, a restart, a health check, a crash, the end) the plugins that are on run the steps they
 * hook to it for this game (`hooks.fire`); a checkpoint (`checkpoint.take`) runs their steps around
 * Genex's own snapshot. The harness never names a plugin's steps: it reads only what they answer
 * (a block, a note, a pending reason, pictures). A game whose descriptor lists no moment
 * (`hookEvents`) gets no call at all, so a game no plugin hooks behaves as it always did.
 *
 * A module of its own: the modules that call it may be ones an agent kept from before, and a kept
 * copy exports only what it did then, so every name the harness newly needs for its moments comes
 * from here. The vocabularies are copies of the app's (`shared/plugin-hooks.ts`), held equal by
 * `seed-contracts.test.ts`.
