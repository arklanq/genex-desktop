/**
 * Blind judging — PLAN.md §8.1, reworked for the scoreboard loop (HARNESS-REWORK.md §4.2).
 *
 * The rules that keep an 8-hour run honest:
 *  - the judge gets a **fresh context**: no build history, no knowledge of which side it wrote;
 *  - candidates are **shuffled and unlabelled**, so "mine" cannot be preferred;
 *  - the judge returns **a pick and the defects it can see** — never a 1-10 score, because
 *    scores drift upward round after round;
 *  - a judge that cannot decide returns a tie, and a tie keeps the incumbent;
 *  - a judge whose answer cannot be read is asked again; one that stays unreadable has not
 *    decided: its verdict is `unusable` and `invalid`, never a tie, and it keeps the incumbent too.
 *    Every A/B verdict records how it was made (`judged`: the rubric's hash, the side the
 *    challenger sat on, the model that answered — judge-provenance.ts) and the call itself
 *    (`judgeCall`: the whole ask's hash, the bounded reply, usage and how many asks it took).
 *
 * v2 adds two narrower instruments and demotes the gestalt one:
 *  - `visionCheck`: one question, one crop, yes/no + confidence — a check, not a verdict,
 *    and `askVisionBoard`, which asks a whole board of them in one call per camera;
 *  - `tasteVeto`: the blind A/B over a facet's cameras, run on an attempt the checks already
 *    accepted; it may block only with a named regression, which becomes a new check;
 *  - `reviewDiff`: the cheap text-only contract review that runs before evidence is spent.
 *
 * Screenshots alone are a weak signal in 3D, so every judgement also carries structural evidence
 * (probes, fps, console errors, WebGL errors). The pixels go in as images when the engine can
 * take them — a path in a text prompt is not a picture. The judging *strategy* lives in
 * `judge/*.md`, which is frozen (R4).
