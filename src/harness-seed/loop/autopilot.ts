/**
 * Autopilot — the orchestrator (AUTOPILOT-PLAN.md §6.2, reworked per HARNESS-REWORK.md §4.5).
 *
 * interview (already happened, in chat) → decompose into typed specs → base builder (the
 * shared commit every facet forks from) → facet loops through the scheduler, continuously
 * merged into a run-level integration branch → integration facet (the merged build gets its
 * own scoreboard and iterations) → global verdict against the base, not the scaffold → close.
 * One facet is the degenerate case and IS the existing gauntlet — same events, same rules.
 *
 * Topology is identical on every engine (A7); the only local-vs-cloud difference is
 * `concurrencyProfile`: delegated/cloud engines run facets in parallel worktrees, a direct
 * local engine runs the same facets sequentially against the live folder, because a 30 tok/s
 * GPU is saturated by one stream.
