Output JSON only, no prose around it:
{"genres":["fps"],"game":{"kind":"<one of the kinds this ask names, or null>","playScript":null},"facets":[{"id":"kebab-slug","title":"…","intent":"…prose brief…","owns":["src/<slug>.js"],"identity":["ranked identity feature","…"],"cameras":["default","camX","eye:spawn"],"checks":[{"id":"kebab","kind":"scene|pixel|probe|demo|vision|play","weight":"identity|normal","hard":false,"…":"…"}],"craft":["flora.leaf-cards"],"milestones":[{"id":"kebab","what":"one structural step — what the game IS after it","check":{"kind":"scene","js":"count('house') >= 6"}}],"budgetShare":0.25}],"mainOwner":"kebab-slug","base":{"notes":"…","files":[{"path":"src/palette.js","purpose":"…"}]},"integrationNotes":"…","assumptions":["…"]}

Rules that never change:
- budgetShare values sum to 1.
- `mainOwner` names exactly ONE facet id — the only facet allowed to edit the game's entry
  (`src/main.js`; a project with its own shape names its own, e.g. `src/main.ts`) and
  `src/studio.js`. Every other facet ships its work as its own module and one import line.
- Every facet has an `intent` (the prose brief) AND `checks`: the contract the harness verifies
  every iteration. A facet with no checks is judged by taste alone and plateaus — give every
  facet 4–10 checks, the majority mechanical (scene/pixel/probe/demo), vision only where
  nothing mechanical fits, at most one `play` check.
{{check-grammar}}
- Craft is not law. How a thing should LOOK — leaf cards, weathered plaster, a warm lamp pool,
  a dark water base — lives in `library/recipes` as craft recipes, not on every board. They are
  retrieved for the builder automatically the moment a check fails or a judge names the matching
  defect, so a plan does not have to ask for them. `craft` is the exception: name up to 3 recipe
  ids there (from the craft menu below) when this facet EXISTS to get one of them right, and the
  harness puts that recipe's check on its board at normal weight. Naming none is a valid plan.
- Liveness is a ladder, not a pack, and it is scoped to the ask. What makes a place feel real —
  the whole extent existing, things where they are used, movement, somewhere to go next — is
  climbed through `milestones` by making what the ask names rich (the roadside a race passes, the
  cars on its grid), never by adding systems it does not name or four more checks. The loop's
  critic scores the principles every iteration (a place: extent, scales, purpose, life, next-step,
  wear, light, material; a screen: readable, state, affordance, feedback, depth, composition,
  palette, finish) and turns its biggest grow gap, or a principle it keeps at 2 for three rounds,
  into the next move by itself; a fix that needs a system the ask does not name is a question for
  the user, never a move — a skyline or a landmark that serves the asked-for mood is not one.
  Write the ladder so the grow principles are climbed in order.
- Assets: when the ask says BLENDER is available, any facet that owns creatures, characters,
  vehicles, weapons or buildings names the assets to model in its intent and takes shape checks
  a modelled object can pass (`objects('dog').some(o => o.userData?.asset)` is the cheapest);
  facets owning different objects model in parallel. Fences, crates and walls stay primitives.
- Sound is a part by default when the game is about feel (racing, flight, a sport, a shooter): a
  facet or module of its own (`src/audio.js`). For racing: an engine synthesised from rpm and
  load, tyres on the surface (squeal, wet hiss), rain and ambience, music. Procedural WebAudio
  (oscillators, filtered noise) is enough for a demo; it starts on the first key press or in
  `config.begin`, a key mutes it, and `config.audio` hands its AnalyserNode to the checks.
- `weight:"identity"` marks the checks the facet exists for (2–4 of them). `hard:true` marks a
  check known to need a technique spike (planar mirror, volumetric fog, first-person effects).
- `milestones` is the facet's ladder: 3–5 ORDERED structural steps inside the ask, each one
  iteration's work, each changing what the game IS (its extent, a mechanic, where the player goes
  next, what the screen tells them) — never how it looks. Once the identity checks hold, the loop
  hands the builder the next unclimbed milestone as THE MOVE of the iteration, and a build that
  only polishes what already exists loses. The ladder must reach the whole intent: "three
  houses and a well" → "the whole hamlet: 6–7 houses, lanes, fences, gardens, outbuildings" →
  "doors that open onto furnished interiors" → "signs of life: smoke, laundry, animals, carts".
  Give each milestone a mechanical `check` where one exists (`count('house') >= 6`,
  `has('doors.open')`); leave `check` null when only a judge can see it.
- Every check names a camera or a tag; `eye:spawn`, `eye:here`, `eye:down`, `eye:back` are
  harness-owned player-eye cameras and may be used without declaring them.
- Reuse ids and thresholds from the check catalogue below when they fit — never invent a second
  id for the same measurement. The catalogue is now small on purpose: five technical checks the
  harness keeps on every board, plus whatever the runs themselves learned, grouped under the
  kind of game that learned it. A group learned on another kind of game is a hypothesis here,
  not a group to take whole — take the entries that fit this ask and leave the rest.
- `genres` names the catalogue groups that apply (fps, characters, arena, puzzle, …); what this
  run's judge learns is filed under them for the next game of that kind. `game` declares what the
  game IS — its `kind`, one of the names the ask lists. The kind already carries whether the game
  has a HUD, mouse look and keyboard movement; add the booleans `hud`, `mouseLook`,
  `keyboardMove` beside it ONLY where this game differs from its kind, and remember that `false`
  is a declaration too — it takes that check off every board. The harness adds its own checks
  only for what is declared: `no-dom-ui`, `single-hud`, `hud-coverage` (the kind's share of the
  frame) and `hud-overlap` when there is a HUD, `look-turns-camera` when the mouse looks,
  `keys-move-player` when keys move, `reaches-play` with either. Do not re-declare those ids. All UI goes through `__studio.hud`
  (drawn into the canvas: text, bars, arcs, paths, images, panels and fonts, anchored in frame
  fractions; the middle of the view stays the game's, and the harness measures the HUD's coverage
  and overlap); all input comes from `ctx.keys` / `ctx.look` / `ctx.wheel`. ONE facet owns the
  screen — the HUD, the title, the start on a key, the countdown and the results — and every other
  facet publishes its values in `__studio.state()` for it, never drawing them. A name or marker
  over something in the world belongs to the scene, attached to that object — give it to the part
  that owns the object, not to the HUD.
- A demo may return data for its checks: name the fields in the check note (e.g. the `ads` demo
  returns `{ sightNdc: {x, y}, crosshairVisible }`).
- `base` lists the shared files every facet forks from (palette, world constants, probe schema,
  empty tagged groups) — the base builder creates them before facets start.
- HOW MANY FACETS is a decision, not a default. When the ask carries a SCOUT REPORT, its
  BUILDERS count is the ceiling: produce that many facets or fewer, and with 1 produce exactly
  one facet for the whole ask. Without a scout, decide from the ask alone: a refinement of one
  existing scene, one map, one look or one mechanic is ONE facet — parallel builders on one
  scene edit the same files and lose their work in the merge. Split only along seams a player can name, each big
  enough to fill an hour on its own. The engine hint's maxParallel is a pool size, never a
  target.
- One facet is a valid answer for a small or tightly-coupled ask — do not split for the sake
  of splitting.
- When the scout report names a requested state (a map behind a picker, a mode, a scene),
  every camera and check describes THAT state — the harness replays the scout's setup before
  each look, and adds the `requested-state` probe itself; do not re-declare it.
- `assumptions` lists the calls you made without data (a lighting mood, a camera style);
  each becomes a decision card the user can overturn mid-run.
<!-- SLOW_UPDATE -->

## What makes a good split

Split along seams a player can name: terrain and skybox, buildings and props, lighting and
atmosphere, player movement and feel, the core verb, sound, UI and readability. Good facets touch
mostly disjoint files; the base commit and the integration notes carry whatever contract they
must share (palette, scale, where the player spawns).

Weight budgetShare by how far each facet is from the reference, not by equal division — the
facet the mood board screams about deserves the largest share.

## What makes a good check

A check is a number or a boolean the harness can compute, phrased so that a failing check tells
the builder what to change, about what a player gets: the race reaches its results, the speed
reads at a glance, the frame rate holds, the console stays clean. How much the build draws (HUD
items, draw calls, triangles) is bounded only from above — the harness refuses a floor — and a
vision check asks what a player can see or read, never the technique that draws it. "Roof pitch
38–45°" is a scene check over the roof mesh normals; "no more than 2% of pixels above 0.9" is a
pixel check on the camera that shows the sky; "the player moved" is a probe check on
delta('player.x'). Write the number down once, in the check — never only in the prose.

## File ownership

Facets that all edit `src/main.js` conflict at merge time by construction. Give every facet its
own module under `src/` (`city.js`, `lighting.js`, `movement.js`) in `owns`, and name in `base`
(its notes and files) what each module exports for the others and the conventions they share
(axes, signs, units, and ranges for content such as a track of 2.5–4 km with 6–12 corners — never a
fixed layout): the base builder writes that contract as crude stubs every facet forks from, in
minutes, and the real content is each facet's to design within those ranges; no facet edits
another's module — what it needs goes through the API. When
the game carries `docs/MODULE-CONTRACT.md` (the harness's) or its own `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, that
is the contract already: read both when present. The `mainOwner` facet is the only one that may
restructure `src/main.js` and `src/studio.js`. Non-owner facets touch main.js only to add their
single import + init line inside the marked FACET WIRING block, and write their notes to
`NOTES.<facet-id>.md`, never the shared `NOTES.md`.

## Priority order inside a bundled facet

When spatial coupling forces one facet to hold more than 3 visual sub-systems, rank them in
`identity` and mark their checks `identity` — the loop works identity checks first and will not
polish a lower item while a higher one still fails.

(SkillOpt-editable guidance accretes below this line.)
