/**
 * Genex's moments and a plugin's locks (manifest `hooks` and `locks`, API 3). At a moment (a run
 * starting, a checkpoint, a restore, a worker starting…) Genex runs the harness tools the enabled
 * plugins hook to it, in plugin order and then declaration order, for the games their `facts`
 * reach. A handler is told the moment (`HookContext`) and answers `HookAnswer`: it may block the
 * moment with a reason, add a note, say it is not ready yet or hand back pictures; it never
 * rewrites arguments and never gives instructions. Git stays Genex's: no hook takes or restores a
 * snapshot. A lock serializes the tools and connectors that `need` it, and gives way to the person
 * while its `personFirst` probe says they are using what it guards.
 *
 * Renderer-safe: no Node. Validation is `substrate/plugins/hook-manifest.ts`; the registry plans a
 * moment through `hookPlan`, and `main/core/plugin-hooks.ts` runs it.
