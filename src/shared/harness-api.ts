/**
 * The harness → host RPC contract: every method `StudioCore.api()` serves to the agent-editable
 * harness (`ctx.call(method, params)`), with the params it takes and the result it answers.
 *
 * `StudioCore.api()` is typed as {@link HarnessHostHandlers}, so a handler that reads a field its
 * params do not declare, or answers something its result does not describe, fails the typecheck.
 * The harness is plain JavaScript and is copied, not imported: its calls are held to the same
 * method names by `tests/conformance/rpc-surface.test.ts`, and its params — for every method that
 * names a file, a folder or a game folder — by {@link HARNESS_PARAM_SCHEMAS}, which
 * `substrate/harness-host.ts` checks before a message reaches its handler.
 *
 * The schemas complement the host's own containment; they never replace it. A path that passes
 * here is still resolved by realpath and refused outside its root by the handler.
