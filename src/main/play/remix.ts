/**
 * Remix: a published game's public source becomes a new game of the person's own. Its repository is
 * cloned shallowly over https from Genex's git into a hidden folder in the games folder, its history
 * is dropped (the copy starts its own), and once whole it moves to a free folder of its own and is
 * adopted as a game without trusting the Claude settings or hooks it came with. Nothing of the copy runs while it is made: no hooks, no
 * content filters, and links come out as plain files. Files the game keeps in Git LFS (its models
 * and textures) come next over https from that same repository, each checked against its pointer,
 * with no git-lfs needed (`lfs.ts`). Then its packages are installed the guarded way (no
 * package's scripts, nothing of the copy running while the registry is open), the folder becomes a
 * game, and it is built once so it opens playing. Each step is told as it starts, and the models
 * as they download; a remix that fails says why in the log.
