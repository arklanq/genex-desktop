/**
 * Play's game viewer: a published game fills the whole window, and the studio's own bar lies over its
 * top edge as glass, in a layer of its own above the game's view (`PlayViewerBar.tsx`): Back, the
 * game's name and facts, Like, Comments, Share, Invite a friend, Remix and Exit. The bar is up while
 * the game loads and fades a few seconds after it plays, coming back at the top edge or on Esc
 * (`bar-reveal.ts`); its Comments opens over the dimmed game (`viewer-comments.ts`). Main keeps what
 * the bar shows and acts on what it asks (`studio:play.control`). Holding Esc in the game moves the
 * keyboard to the bar (a tap still reaches the game: pause menus, mouse lock); Esc there gives it
 * back. A guest with no Genex account is offered a Genex account in the bar until its ×. A game in
 * voice chat gets the bar's mic switch and its menu (`mic.ts`). Electron-free: the game's view, the
 * bar's layer, the window, the clipboard, the microphone and the clock come in as deps.
