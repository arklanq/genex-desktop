 * Native games being played: each in its own window, in the game sandbox (`spawnNativeGame`), at

 * earlier Genex left running (only while its process is still that one). A game that quits before
 * its window appears failed to start; its last output goes to the log, never on screen. A game opens
 * full screen with its engine's own argument, unless its app asks for a window.
