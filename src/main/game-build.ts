/**
 * Building a game that builds itself — outside the user's folder, and only when something changed.
 *
 * Three things were wrong with running `npm run build` in place on every look:
 * the user's own `dist/` was overwritten by the studio on every Reload, checkpoint and health
 * check; the build ran again for a tree nobody had touched; and when it failed the stage went
 * black with the reason reaching only the game console.
 *
 * So a game the user owns is built in a **shadow**: a mirror of its source under the app's own
 * scratch, its output kept beside it. The mirror is the folder's tracked files plus whatever is
 * modified, untracked-but-not-ignored, or an `.env` — git already knows exactly which files are
 * the game and which 1.6 GB of screenshots are not. A worktree under the app's scratch is
 * already ours, so it is built where it stands.
 *
 * The last output that worked is kept, because "your last build" is a better thing to look at
 * than a black rectangle — but only the *live* stage may fall back to it. A judge scoring a
 * stale build would be scoring a lie, which is why {@link servedAfterBuild} takes the decision
 * away from the caller's memory and puts it in one testable rule.
