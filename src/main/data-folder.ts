 * Where the normal profile keeps its data, when the person moved it (Settings → Storage). Electron's

 * not happen and why, `leftover` the entries copies left behind (an old folder's originals, a failed
 * move's copies), still to be removed.
 *
 * `boot.ts` reads it first thing, before Electron opens any of its data, and points userData (and
 * the session's data with it) at the folder in use. A launch that moves the data, or cannot find
 * it, runs on a folder of its own in the temp folder instead, so nothing it starts holds a file in
 * the folder being moved. Developer, test and installer launches never move or wait for the data:
 * they only follow a finished move, so they still know where the normal profile's data is.
