/**
 * The `desktop` tool: the same computer vocabulary and the same session referee as a game's
 * `computer` (`computer-session.ts`), on the person's desktop or a VM. It is offered to the
 * sessions the person is answering, on every engine — Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, the local
 * sessions and the harness's own loop all receive it as one more live tool.
 *
 * Nothing moves before the person says so: the first call asks whether the agent may see the
 * screen and use the computer this session, and each app it then reaches is asked for once
 * (`desktop-target.ts`). A no is the answer the model reads, never a failure. The driver starts
 * on the first call and stops with the session. Computer control is a setting (Settings →
 * Permissions, off by default): while it is off, every call answers so and nothing starts.
