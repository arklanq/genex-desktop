/**
 * Rewinding a game chat (`shared/chat-rewind.ts`): a message and everything after it leave the
 * conversation (the log keeps them), the provider sessions that remember them are dropped, and,
 * when asked, the game files go back to the checkpoint taken before that message was answered
 * (`../chat-checkpoints.ts`). A build running in the chat is stopped first; its rows, and those of
 * every build started after the message, leave the conversation with it. This service also takes
 * those checkpoints as the queue starts and settles each message, holds sends and other changes to
 * a chat while it is being rewound, and gives the harness the log as the conversation reads after
 * its rewinds.
 * Composed by `StudioCore`; its state stays here.
