/**
 * The host side of the bundled Genex plugin's `host` tools: `genex__cli` and `genex__cli-paid` run
 * Studio's own pinned Genex CLI through the process sandbox.
 *
 * A run never happens in the game folder. There the CLI rewrites `.claude/skills`, `AGENTS.md`
 * and the contracts of every ancestor folder whenever the folder looks like a Genex workspace,
 * which an agent can arrange at any moment and which an unsandboxed profile would not stop. So
 * each call gets a fresh folder under `<userData>/genex-cli`, outside every agent's writable roots,
 * with HOME at that folder (the CLI's contract healing stops at HOME), and the folder is removed
 * afterwards. A project command sees only the hosted project's id and slug, mirrored from the
 * publish workspace. The token reaches the CLI on stdin through Studio's preload, never argv,
 * environment or disk; the sandbox opens the Genex API alone for the length of the run, and Genex's
 * object storage beside it only for a call that moves a store item's files. A store
 * item's picture, model and package are files of the bound game: Studio checks each by real path
 * inside it and copies it into the run folder first; `items add` writes `genex-items/<id>/` in the
 * run folder, and Studio moves it into the game afterwards (`genex-game-paths.ts`). The game's local
 * item drafts (`.genex/items/`, made before the game is on Genex) are copied in for the shop's
 * commands, and a change carried back (`local-item-files.ts`); a `shop add|set|remove` in a game with
 * no hosted project runs on them alone. Studio itself uploads them after a publish
 * (`syncLocalItems`) and runs the person's "Other games can use it" on one (`setLocalShared`).
