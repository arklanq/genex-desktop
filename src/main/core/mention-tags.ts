/**
 * A message's @ tags, made real before the agent reads it: a game on this Mac becomes a read-only
 * folder the chat may read, a genex.games game or tool is copied beside the game to read, an
 * asset's module is added to the game's `src/assets/`, and an asset from the person's own library
 * has its file copied into the game's `assets/library/`.
 *
 * The renderer sends identities only (a library name, a slug, a generation id); every decision is
 * made here again, against the library and genex.games, because a picker's list can be minutes old.
 *
 * Nothing here refuses a message. A tag that can't be attached is named to the agent with the
 * reason, shown in the chat, and the message still goes.
