/**
 * A game that speaks the Genex Play Protocol (docs/play-protocol.md) as a computer target: the
 * game runs as its own process, started through the ProcessSandbox, and every look, key, click
 * and clock move the `computer` session makes becomes a protocol op on its stdin. What the game
 * can do comes from its `hello`, never assumed; a game that speaks another protocol version is
 * refused at load. An op it refuses ends that action (keys and buttons it pressed are let go),
 * is not counted as applied and is kept for the session to read (`refusals`), never retried.
 *
 * `gameBridgeSource` is the session's source for such a game: it reads the play command the
 * project's studio.json declares, starts it, hands the session the target, and stops the
 * process (quit, then kill after a grace) when the session is released or the build changes.
