/**
 * Permissions in a game chat, the host's half: which delegation a person is answering, the mode it
 * runs in (the chat's own, as far as its engine honours it: `engineMode`), the Allow / Deny questions it asks (recorded in the chat as
 * `tool_permission` rows and waited on in the ledger), what "always" keeps, and the picker's reach
 * into a running session. Composed by `StudioCore`; reached through `CoreInternals.permissions`.
 *
 * Who asks is decided here from what the host recorded itself, never from what the harness says:
 * the message the person sent on this thread (`notePersonMessage`, from the composer's send), the
 * thread's own metadata, and the shape of the brief (`DelegationService`). A harness that forges
 * any of it can only make a session ask the person, in the mode the person chose.
 *
 * A build's lead and the run's coordinator ask too (`forLead`): they are the chat's main agent, so
 * only the chat's mode and the rules the person saved limit them, as the chat's own session. Each
 * runs in the chat's Auto, Accept edits or Bypass (Claude Code then acts as for the chat's own
 * session), or in Manual, the host answering each question for the chat's mode: Plan denies, and
 * anything else is a card, whether or not the person is talking to it, withdrawn when nobody
 * answers within `LEAD_ASK_TIMEOUT_MS`. The picker switches a running lead as it switches the chat's
 * own session, beside it on the same chat (`#live`); while the chat is in a mode a lead could not
 * be switched to, its screen asks first (`#screenLeadCall`), so the chat's mode answers.
 *
 * A worker of the chat's lead asks the same way (`forWorker`), in the chat's mode, and the picker
 * switches its running session as it switches a lead's: its card names it, a run worker's is
 * withdrawn when nobody answers within `LEAD_ASK_TIMEOUT_MS` as a lead's is, and "always" counts for
 * the whole chat, so the next worker and the chat's own session stand on it.
 *
 * The person's switch to Bypass answers every card still waiting that was asked in another mode
 * (`ToolPermissions.allowInBypass`), and an "always" that names a mode moves only a Manual chat:
 * it never takes a chat out of a mode the person moved it to since.
