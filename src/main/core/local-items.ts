/**
 * A game's local item drafts once it is on Genex (contract "Local item drafts"): after a publish
 * finishes, and when the game is opened or the window comes back (paced, one at a time per game),
 * Studio runs its own `genex shop sync --json` while the game holds drafts, then puts on sale only
 * the uploaded drafts the person approved with the very content hash the sync reports
 * (`itemPutOnSale`, as Put on sale does). A draft changed since its approval stays a draft and says
 * so; genex.games' refusals (of the upload, or of Put on sale) are kept with their codes for the
 * cards. Only Studio's own sync names what goes on sale: nothing in the game folder does (D40).
 * The person's approvals, the drafts as the CLI printed them and the outcomes live in Studio's app
 * data (`item-approvals.ts`). Electron-free: everything outside comes in as deps.
