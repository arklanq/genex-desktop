/**
 * Tool permission ledger: the wait between a game chat's Claude session asking to use a tool and
 * the person's answer in the chat. Modelled on the plugin consent ledger, with one difference:
 * the chat's own session has no timeout. Claude Code waits for the person, so this does too; the
 * delegation's own deadline and Stop still end the wait through the signal and `cancel()`. Only a
 * build's lead or the run's coordinator asks with a `timeoutMs`: nobody may be looking at its
 * card, and a run must not wait on it (a run's worker asks as it does). Its card also outlives the chat's turns (`outlivesTurn`):
 * the lead is not the chat's turn, so another message's turn ending is not its end. Settles each
 * request exactly once and never touches disk or the event log: the permission service records
 * the question and its answer around it.
