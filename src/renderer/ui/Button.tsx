/**
 * RULES (AG-893): the PRIMITIVE owns the family. A button label is Geist Mono -
 * that is the product's voice - and baking it here is what makes that true of
 * every button instead of the 35 call sites out of 165 that happened to tag it
 * by hand. `font-mono` carries the house -0.02em from globals.css, so a button
 * never needs its own `tracking-*` either.
 *
 * IT ALSO OWNS THE SIZE, and that claim was FALSE for a day (owner round 5,
 * 2026-08-17: "I don't see that this is a small size, as if you are deceiving
 * me" - and he was right, measured at 36px). `defaultVariants` said `sm`, but
 * the component signature also wrote `size = "default"`, and a default
 * PARAMETER wins: cva only falls back to its own default when the prop is
 * `undefined`, so every one of the 130 call sites that passes no size was
 * silently handed the 36px one. The rule is therefore structural: `size` and
 * `variant` take their defaults from `defaultVariants` BELOW and must never
 * carry a default in the parameter list. `data-size` restates the resolved
 * value for the drift gate, which is the only reason it needs the `??`.
