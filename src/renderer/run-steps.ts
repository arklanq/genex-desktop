/**
 * Steps — what the Builds graph draws, folded out of the run graph and its recorded summary.
 *
 * A part is a row. Its rounds fold into steps: every try at the same move or fix is one node,
 * and the group ends at the try the judges kept. What reached the build sits on the row's line
 * and runs on to the result; anything that did not (an undone step, a stopped one, the work in
 * hand) hangs below it. A part with nothing on the line keeps its nodes on the row, ghosted, and
 * never joins the result.
 *
 * A step's state comes from the build first and the judges second. A round nobody judged is not left
 * unexplained when the lead merged the part's work afterwards: that work is in the build, and
 * the lead is who checked it. The judges show as a gate — an eye on the edge into a node they
 * looked at; a node the lead let in has no eye.
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no window. `panels/RunGraph.tsx` draws it and the tests read it directly.
