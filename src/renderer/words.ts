/**
 * Words — the one place a harness word becomes a user word.
 *
 * The harness talks to itself in run ids, facet titles, verdict sources and tool names. None of
 * that is the user's language: they asked for a game, and the only questions they ever ask are
 * "is my game being worked on?" and "what happened to it?". Every label in the app that starts
 * life inside `src/harness-seed` passes through this module first, so the translation is written
 * once, tested once (tests/conformance/words.test.ts), and cannot drift between the titlebar,
 * the rail, the chat and the graph.
 *
 * Two rules hold this module together:
 *   1. It is pure — no React, no window, and no runtime imports but the shared run rules
 *      (`shared/run-state.ts`), which decide what a round's verdict *was* (this decides what it is
 *      called), the app's words in the reader's language (`shared/i18n.ts`), and the vocabularies
 *      its tables are keyed by (the platform, how a chat's file opens, Claude Code's permission
 *      modes and their own names, an agent's screen deeds) and the time units it counts in. It is
 *      a lookup table.
 *   2. No output may carry an identifier. Run ids and commit shas belong behind "Details";
 *      `withoutIds` is the last gate every phrase passes through, so even a facet title the
 *      director invented with a sha in it comes out readable.
