/**
 * Where every asset sits on the Assets canvas — pure, so the arrangement can be checked without
 * a window and never depends on the order the walk happened to return files in.
 *
 * Two rules decide the order, and both are about a person looking for something they just made:
 *
 *   1. Sources come in a fixed order — Genex first, then Blender, then any other plugin
 *      alphabetically, with the files you dropped in yourself last. A plugin installed during a run
 *      must not reshuffle yesterday's canvas.
 *   2. Inside a source, jobs are newest first, and the files of one job keep their own order by
 *      path. A generation that takes minutes therefore appears at the top and stays there.
 *
 * The rectangles are laid out in that order, five to a row, with fixed card sizes per kind, so
 * the same ledger always draws the same canvas.
