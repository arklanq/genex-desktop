 * Run graph — the pure data model behind the Build room's node-graph view of an Autopilot run.
 *
 * Everything here is derived from the thread's event log alone (the log is the source of truth),
 * with no DOM in sight, so the shape of the graph and its layout can be unit-tested.
 * `panels/RunGraph.tsx` renders it.
 *
 *   Run → Base → Facet (one column each) → iteration 1 → iteration 2 → … → Integration → Final
 *
 * plus dashed cross-edges for defects the judge routed to another facet and for builder flags
 * that name a target facet. `run-steps.ts` folds it into what the Builds tab draws. The payload
 * readers live in `run-graph-parse.ts`, the asset cards in `run-graph-assets.ts` and the workers'
 * and jobs' records in `run-graph-workers.ts`, the finish check's rounds in `run-graph-finish.ts`.
 *
 * A graph holding a worker's, a job's or a finish check's records is a tree: the lead is a node of
 * its own, carrying the jobs, and a run's tree ends in the finish check until the run finishes, or
 * for good once the lead made a claim. A chat turn that
 * started workers is a graph of its own, keyed by the turn (`shared/run-graph-events.ts`).
