/**
 * The bar's layer over the game (`play-bar.html`, a transparent view main lays above the game's own):
 * the viewer's bar, and its Comments over the dimmed game. It hears the viewer's news as the studio's
 * page does, asks main for the bar's controls, and tells main what holds the bar up: the pointer or
 * the keyboard on it, or Comments open (main then lays the layer over the whole window and gives it
 * the keyboard, and gives the game the keyboard back once Comments closes). Esc here gives the
 * keyboard back to the game; before the game plays it leaves, as the cover's does.
