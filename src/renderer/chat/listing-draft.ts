/**
 * The Listing draft card's model (marketplace P11, plan 8.3; screen 09): what the card shows for a
 * store item the game's agent made, and which presses it offers. Its words are the draft's (the
 * agent's latest `genex shop add|set`); whether it is on sale and shared is what genex.games last
 * answered a press with, else the draft's. Put on sale shows while the item is a draft or off sale;
 * an item an admin took off sale offers nothing (D14); "Other games can use it" is for a durable
 * only (P3). The presses themselves are the items store's (`state/items.ts`), carried out by main.
 *
 * A local draft (made before its game is on Genex) offers "Sell when published" instead: the person's
 * approval of what it holds now, which main honours after the game's publish only for that very
 * content. Once the publish uploaded it, its card is the item's on genex.games, with what became of
 * it: on sale, a draft (changed since the approval, or never approved), or refused with a reason.
