/**
 * Live chat, as the composer reads it: while a build whose lead takes the chat runs, a message
 * goes to that lead at once and is answered in the chat (the seed's `loop/live-chat.ts`), instead
 * of waiting behind the build. The build's start says whether its lead does (`liveChat`); a run
 * on the long turn, or one whose director predates live chat, says nothing and keeps its queue.
 * A slash command still waits, and so does a message sent after Finish (`pending-sends.ts`
 * `leadTakesSend`).
