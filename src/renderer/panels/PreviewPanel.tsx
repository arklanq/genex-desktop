/**
 * The stage — user story 1, 2, 4.
 *
 * Two views. Live: the actual pixels come from a native `WebContentsView` that main positions
 * on top of this placeholder, so this component owns the rectangle and reports it back. When
 * nothing can run yet (no model) the stage teaches setup instead of sitting empty.
 *
 * Builds: an Autopilot run as a timeline (`RunGraph`) — every part's rounds with their stills
 * and the judges' verdicts, live. A reply about a node goes through the chat's composer
 * (`reply-about.ts`) and lands in the builders' next brief through the steering inbox. An earlier
 * build opens from its result card in the chat (`open-build.ts`); the latest is Builds' default.
 * The stage never pulls itself there: the one thing a user always wants to see is their game,
 * so Live stays until they choose otherwise, and it never changes while they watch it — a new
 * build or a changed game marks Reload instead (`stage.ts` holds the rules).
 *
 * `stage/` holds the pieces: the live page load and its probe, the native view's rectangle, the
 * build-problem strip, what waits for Live's Reload, the strip over the stage and its empty states.
