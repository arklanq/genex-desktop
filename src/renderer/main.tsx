/**
 * Renderer entry.
 *
 * Two rooms: Build (chat + the live game) and Review (what it did unattended, and what it changed
 * about itself). The renderer holds no state the log does not: it subscribes to substrate events
 * and renders them, so what you see is always a view of the agent's actual state.
 *
 * Before any of that, the window asks main where startup stands (`state/boot.ts`): the platform
 * sets `data-platform` on the root (the window chrome is laid out by it), and while the process
 * sandbox cannot start the window shows the setup screen instead of the studio.
 *
 * Styling comes from dist/renderer/theme.css (the shared Genex Tailwind system), linked by
 * index.html — there is no CSS import here for esbuild to bundle.
