/**
 * The sandbox user's read-attributes entry on one folder, set or taken back on that folder alone.
 * It allows SYNCHRONIZE too: CreateFileW adds it to every synchronous open, and Node's stat opens
 * the folder that way on Windows before 11 24H2 (no GetFileInformationByName), so an entry with
 * read attributes alone refused the harness's realpath with EPERM on `AppData`.
 *
 * `icacls`, like every call that sets a folder's DACL by name or handle (SetNamedSecurityInfo,
 * SetSecurityInfo, PowerShell's Set-Acl), re-propagates the folder's inheritable entries to
 * everything under it, even when the entry it adds is not inheritable. A grant on `AppData` walked
 * all of it (1.6 s per 10,000 files on a hosted runner, 16 ms on an empty folder) and held each
 * folder open while it did, so removing a folder in there failed meanwhile. `SetFileSecurityW`
 * writes the one folder's DACL and nothing else, which is all an entry without inheritance needs.
 * Node cannot call it, so one Windows PowerShell run per batch does, through a P/Invoke defined
 * at run time (no compiler). Where PowerShell may not do that (Constrained Language Mode), or
 * does not answer, the batch falls back to `icacls`: slow, but the same entries.
 *
 * The same script sets the entries Genex keeps itself for the sandbox users' group (`ownAclEntries`
 * in `windows-sandbox.ts`): a grant on each folder the sandbox may use and a deny on each path it
 * may not, each passed down to everything under its path, and a FILE_DELETE_CHILD deny on a denied
 * path's parent folder alone. A deny on a path the sandbox user can open nothing under anyway (a
 * browser profile only its owner, SYSTEM and the Administrators may open, checked entry by entry)
 * waits for its walk ({@link OwnWalk}): walking one took 17 s of a lived-in Windows 11 first start.
 * Those have no `icacls` fallback: `icacls` would walk a denied path's parent, which is what they
 * exist to avoid.
