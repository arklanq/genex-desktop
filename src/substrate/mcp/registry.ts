/**
 * The connector registry — the MCP half of what `PluginRegistry` is for plugins.
 *
 * It owns the connector list, one `McpConnection` per enabled connector, the tool cache, health
 * and leases, and it is the only thing that turns a server's tools into names an engine may
 * call. Everything it publishes is namespaced `<connectorId>__<exposedTool>` and travels the
 * existing `liveTools`/`onLiveTool` channel, so Claude Code, Codex and the local harness get one
 * trust, consent and observability model instead of three.
 *
 * Four rules it never bends:
 *  - **Agents cannot mutate connectors.** There is no save or remove on the RPC table; every
 *    mutation here is reached from the Studio UI through IPC.
 *  - **A stdio connector launches only on a matching trust digest.** A hand-edited
 *    connectors.json cannot start a different program than the one the user approved.
 *  - **One broken connector is not a broken delegation.** `toolsFor` connects in parallel, isolates
 *    failures, and a server that will not answer contributes nothing and reads `failed`.
 *  - **`tool()` fails closed.** Disabled, out of scope, untrusted, denied by policy or simply
 *    unknown all refuse before anything is spawned.
 *
 * A connection is opened per project only when the project changes what the server sees (a
 * per-project launch, or a shared project root); every other connector runs one process for all
 * games. A connection with no lease and no call for `idleCloseMs` is closed, and the next use
 * opens it again.
