/**
 * Each game's link to an engine project, kept by the host for a `game-engine` plugin, to a project
 * of the engine it declares (`engine` in its manifest, whose `projectFiles` say what a project file
 * is), with the published game's ids when the project lives at the engine's service. The record
 * that routes the plugin's calls lives in the plugin's own storage (`links/<game>.json`), where its
 * MCP servers read it and agents can't write; the game's studio.json gets a mirror for the brief,
 * the UI and the harness (`substrate/game-engine-binding.ts`). A link is made by real path, the
 * chat it came from (the game's own chat for a link made in the panel) gets one line with Undo, and
 * a refused link changes nothing on disk. A link that also set its project up (`setUp`) keeps that
 * in its record, and its Undo has the plugin take the set-up back first (`undoSetUp`), unless
 * another game's current link names the same project: that game builds in it too, so only the link
 * is undone.
