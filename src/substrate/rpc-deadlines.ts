/**
 * How long the host services one harness call before it answers the harness with a timeout.
 *
 * A call nobody answers keeps the harness awaiting it, and a harness awaiting the host is not
 * wedged, so the watchdog stays quiet while any call is in flight. A generated game whose
 * `state()` never returns, or a page that stops answering, therefore used to freeze a whole run
 * with nothing to notice it. Every call now has a class, and a class with a deadline is answered
 * with `RpcDeadline` once it passes; the watchdog sees the harness's own silence again after that.
 *
 * Engine work, runs, snapshots and plugin calls bound themselves (the engines' timeouts, consent
 * windows, the director's tool timeout) and some legitimately take hours, so their class has none.
