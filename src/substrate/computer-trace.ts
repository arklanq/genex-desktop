/**
 * The trace of a computer session: one JSON line per action, written beside the session's frames
 * (`trace.jsonl`). It records what was done, by which route, what the target showed and how much
 * simulated time passed, so a judge's evidence can be read back, a playthrough scrubbed, and a run
 * that reached its goal kept as a route to replay on later builds (`harness-seed/loop/routes.ts`).
 *
 * Electron-free and pure: the session decides what goes in a row; this module only shapes it.
