/**
 * Harness process supervision.
 *
 * One mechanism does three jobs, exactly as the plan intends: **restarting this process is
 * hot-reload of the agent's self-edits, is crash recovery, and is the guardian's "rebuild".**
 *
 *  - Boot: spawn the stable bootstrap (shipped in the app) inside the sandbox; it dynamically
 *    imports the *editable* harness from the workspace.
 *  - Self-modification: `guardian.rebuild_and_restart` writes a durable update record, snapshots
 *    the workspace, lets the current turn finish, then respawns. The outcome is appended to the
 *    log as a `custom` event so the reborn agent reads its own restart from its own state.
 *  - Failure: the watchdog (crash-loop or log silence) restores the newest *healthy* snapshot and
 *    restarts, appending `workspace_restored`.
