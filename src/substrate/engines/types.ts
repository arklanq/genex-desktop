 * Two kinds of builder, one interface, chosen per task and recorded in the log:
 *
 *  - **direct** (`complete`): the studio's own turn loop drives the model and executes tools
 *    itself. v1: Ollama through pi-ai. This is the unlimited unattended workhorse (D8).
 *  - **delegated** (`delegate`): a vendor harness does the whole build itself; we mirror its
 *    events into our log and improve the *brief* it reads. Two of them: Claude Code through the
 *    Agent SDK, and Codex through `codex exec` on a ChatGPT subscription. Each authenticates
 *    with its own subscription login (D8 — we never see or store a token), and each translates
 *    its own event stream into the one vocabulary the studio's log speaks.
 *
 * The API keys the studio holds are OpenRouter's and a local server's (`local-server.ts`), direct
 * engines on the same pi-ai path as Ollama's: each key is pasted in Settings, kept in the OS secret
 * store, and never leaves main.
 * OpenCode is a third delegated harness, which keeps its own sign-ins in its own store.
