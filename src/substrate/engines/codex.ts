/**
 * Delegated engine — Codex on a ChatGPT subscription, the second
 * subscription the studio can hire.
 *
 * **Compliance boundary, restated because it constrains the code:** we do not route a consumer
 * subscription through a model API ourselves — that is prohibited. The sanctioned mechanic is
 * "your subscription, through their harness": we spawn the `codex` CLI, which performs its own
 * ChatGPT login and keeps its own credentials in its own home. The studio never sees, stores or
 * forwards a token. `CODEX_HOME` points at a dedicated home under `userData` when the studio
 * owns the login; that directory is on the sandbox's deny-read list for agent processes.
 * `CODEX_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_KEY` are stripped from every child environment built here, so a
 * key lying around in the user's shell can never flip this to a metered bill (the mirror of
 * what `claude-code.ts` does with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
 *
 * **Three things differ from the Claude Code path, and each is a deliberate choice:**
 *
 *  1. *Transport.* There is no SDK; the contract is `codex exec --json`, a JSONL event stream on
 *     stdout. Those events are translated here into the same compacted vocabulary the Claude
 *     path emits (`system/init`, `assistant` with `parts`, `result`), so the chat, the run graph
 *     and the morning review read a Codex build with no idea it was Codex.
 *  2. *Studio tools.* `codex exec` auto-denies MCP tool calls — a non-interactive session has
 *     nobody to approve them — and the only way round it is to give up the contractor's sandbox.
 *     Instead the studio's tools arrive as a command the contractor runs (`studio-bridge.ts`).
 *  3. *Ownership.* There is no `PreToolUse` hook to refuse a stray Write, so the facet's
 *     non-owned files are made read-only for the delegation (`ownership-locks.ts`) and the
 *     contractor's own sandbox does the refusing.

   * local judge uses, spelled the way Codex spells it.
   *
   * **A known gap.** The Claude critic is toolless by construction —
   * `disallowedTools` takes Read, Bash and the rest away. Codex has no equivalent switch: its
   * shell tool cannot be removed, and `read-only` restrains writes, not reads. So the critic is
   * *told* what is off limits and started somewhere with nothing in it, rather than being
   * prevented at the boundary. Judge on both subscriptions and the panel is stronger for it.
   *
   * **The same gap, one step further: the CONTEXT this session inherits.** The Claude critic is
   * emptied at the boundary too (`settingSources: ["project"]`, `mcpServers: {}`, `skills: []`),
   * so nothing of the owner's own machine reaches a verdict. Codex has no equivalent switch
   * either. `--ignore-user-config` covers `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` and nothing else; the CLI
   * still injects `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md` as `# AGENTS.md instructions` and lists
   * `$CODEX_HOME/skills` in a `<skills_instructions>` block, and `CODEX_HOME` is the owner's own
   * `~/.codex` whenever the studio borrows their sign-in. `project_doc_max_bytes` does not reach
   * the global doc (0 and 1 both leave it whole) and there is no `skills` feature flag to
   * disable, so the same remedy applies as above: the critic is TOLD, in `JUDGE_RULES`, that
   * instructions it did not come here for are not part of the question.
   *
   * A third consequence of `--ephemeral`, for whoever reads a transcript census: a critic
   * session writes no rollout, so no per-role report built from session files can count one.
