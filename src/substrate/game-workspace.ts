/**
 * Game workspaces — the "nothing trapped" product principle.
 *
 * A project is a plain folder of ES modules that runs directly in the preview through the
 * `game://` protocol. There is deliberately **no bundler and no package manager**: three.js is
 * vendored with the app and resolved through an import map, so scaffolding is instantaneous,
 * works with the sandbox's network switched off, and a snapshot restore is a pure `git checkout`
 * with nothing to reinstall.
 *
 * Folders may live **anywhere the user owns** — Cursor/Codex's model. `~/AI Games` is the default
 * library for "New Folder"; "Use Existing" and Recents point at arbitrary paths. Chat history
 * stays in the app's own data; the folder is the game plus any stills the user dropped in.
 *
 * Export is therefore almost free: copy the project, copy the vendored library next to it, and
 * the result is a static site anyone can host.
 *
 * What a folder's page loads lives in `game-page.ts`, how it runs in `project-shape.ts`, the
 * repositories inside it in `nested-repos.ts` and the pre-judge check in `game-validation.ts`;
 * this module re-exports what its callers have always imported from here.
