/**
 * Seed upgrades — closing the trap that bit twice on day one.
 *
 * The harness workspace is the agent's own editable copy of the seed, created on first launch.
 * Naively it was seeded only when missing, so a fix shipped in the app's `src/harness-seed`
 * never reached an existing install — twice in one evening someone had to quit the app and
 * delete the workspace by hand to pick up a one-line guard fix.
 *
 * The upgrade rule respects full recursion (hard constraint #1 — the agent owns its source):
 * a **manifest** outside the workspace records the hash of the seed content last applied to
 * each file. On boot, for every file in the new seed:
 *
 *  - not in the manifest              → new seed file  → copy in            ("added")
 *  - workspace hash == manifest hash  → agent untouched → apply the new seed ("updated")
 *  - workspace hash != manifest hash  → agent edited it → LEAVE IT           ("kept")
 *  - in the manifest but deleted      → agent deleted it → leave it deleted  ("kept")
 *
 * There is a fifth outcome, for a path the seed used to ship and no longer does: when the
 * workspace copy still hashes to what the manifest last applied, it is backed up and removed
 * ("retired"). See RETIRED_SEED_PATHS.
 *
 * Files the agent created itself (memory, self-installed tools) are never touched. Replaced
 * files are backed up first, so even a wrong call here is recoverable without git archaeology.
 *
 * Installs from before this file exist have no manifest. They also predate the first
 * self-edit (the manifest ships before the first unattended run), so the one-time migration
 * treats the whole workspace as untouched: the new seed is applied file by file and the
 * manifest written. From then on every install has one.

 * tool. `plugins.tools` names the game (`project`), whose facts pick its plugin tools: a kept copy
 * that names none is offered a web game's tools whatever the game holds. `applySeed` reports such a
 * copy (`outdatedCalls`, each file once) and the boot notes it for the agent. The Unreal lead's
 * runner calls from `loop/unreal/lead-steps.ts`, new with the step change, so no kept copy of it is
 * older (a kept `lead-journal.ts` that still defines its own call is a move). `game.scaffold` with
 * no `kind` now makes an empty folder with no kind: a kept Loop launch or runner that names no kind
 * makes its new game empty, a kept run start leaves a game with no kind unstarted before its web
 * Loop, and a kept `tools/game-tools.ts` has no `start_web_game` for a local model. A kept
 * `loop/prompt.ts` that never reads `prompts/operating-rules-web.md` gives a web game's local turn
 * no web rules, so it is reported the same way; so are a kept `prompts/operating-rules.md` that
 * still gives every turn the web rules, and a kept `loop/chat-session.ts` that briefs a new game
 * (now empty) as the web starter and never names `start_web_game`. A kept `loop/main.ts` that never
 * claims `workers`, a kept `loop/delegated-turn.ts` that opens no worker pool for a chat turn, and a
 * kept `loop/chat-session.ts` whose brief never says the session runs workers leave the chat's own
 * session without its workers (or unaware of them), so they are reported too. The director joined
 * the same model: a kept tool list or handler without `WorkerTool.` has no `worker_mark` and no
 * readers, a kept wake prompt or brief still names the old `wait`, kept builders delegate with no
 * `worker` grant (they stay unattended and boxed: safe, but not in the chat's mode), a kept wake loop
 * still names a rejected worker, and a kept close leaves the run's readers to end on their own.
 * A kept `tools/game-tools.ts` whose `game.start` names no chat writes the web starter even while
 * that chat is in Plan mode; kept briefs, builders and base sessions of a director's run that never
 * open with Genex's identity leave its workers unaware they work inside Genex, on which folder.
 * A kept director handler that never reads its builders' questions leaves the lead blind to a
 * builder waiting on the person, a kept build turn treats a full chat as a broken build, and a kept
 * tool list offers its readers no research. A kept wake loop that never reads the run's job ends
 * leaves a resting lead asleep through them; kept wake rules lack their kind (such an end still
 * wakes the lead soon, as news); and a kept `loop-run.ts` or journal that keeps no job cursor reads the
 * run's ends again after a restart. Kept builders or chat turns that write no worker records leave
 * those workers off Builds and the chat; a kept run start without `workerRecords` draws its Loop as a
 * tree only from its first worker; a kept tool list never tells the lead the person reads its note.
 * A kept chat turn from before Genex's moments never takes Genex's checkpoint at its end and never
 * announces its turn to the game's plugins; kept director parts never announce the run's start, end,
 * turns, finish or builders, and a kept run start never reads the moments the game's plugins hook.

/**
 * Seed files the app used to ship and no longer does, which a workspace should stop carrying.
 *
 * `applySeed` walks the seed directory, so a file the seed drops is simply never visited again:
 * every install that ever booted the older build keeps its copy for ever, in the prompt index,
 * in the skill list, in the architect's file menu. These four skills were read by no run code
 * (only `director.md` and `facet-decomposition.md` are) and said things about a loop that no
 * longer exists. The workers' handover modules went when Claude Code and Codex workers were left
 * to their own compaction: nothing imports them, and a copy left behind would fail
 * the self-edit gate's type check over `loop/` (it reads facet state that no longer exists).
 *
 * The rule is the ownership rule, backwards: a workspace copy whose bytes still equal what the
 * manifest last applied was written by the app and may go; anything else is the agent's and is
 * kept for ever. On a pre-manifest install there is nothing to compare against and the one-time
 * migration already reads the whole workspace as the app's, so the copy goes on that pass — the
 * only pass that could: the seed no longer ships these paths, so they never acquire a manifest
 * entry of their own, and a later boot would find nothing to act on. The copy is backed up
 * first, which is why the pass refuses to run at all when no `backupDir` was passed (the
 * crash-recovery reseed path).
 *
 * The Unreal Loop's part plan and part prompts went with the part runner, and the step machine that
 * replaced it (its planner, keep rule, board, probes, checkpoint, helpers, prompts, tools, graph,
 * the part runner's shim) went when one lead took over (`loop/unreal/lead.ts`); an untouched copy
 * left behind would no longer type-check against the seed (`cpp.ts`, `live-contract.ts`). Two of
 * its files stay as shims, because files the agent may have kept import from them:
 * `loop/unreal/live.ts` (a kept `run-dispatch.ts`'s `runUnrealLive`, the lead now) and
 * `loop/unreal/live-journal.ts` (a kept `restore.ts`'s `unrealTool`, in `SEED_MOVES`). So do the
 * lead's own reading of whether Unreal is there (`editor-life.ts`) and a chat's own waits and reads
 * of Unreal (`editor-wait.ts`, `editor-wait-prompts.ts`, `editor-activity.ts`): no current module
 * calls them since Genex's `health`, checkpoint and kinds' readiness took them over, but kept copies
 * of `delegated-turn.ts`, `unreal-prompts.ts`, `lead-turn.ts`, `restore.ts` and `save-point.ts`
 * still import them, so they stay until the Unreal runner's last by-name calls go.
 *
 * The JavaScript modules the TypeScript seed replaced (`loop/*.mjs` → `loop/*.ts`) are not listed
 * here: retiring an agent-edited `x.mjs` would keep it for ever beside an `x.ts` that is the one
 * loaded, dropping the edit without a word. `migrateHarnessLayout` owns them — it removes the
 * untouched ones (recording them in the manifest's `retired` too) and renames the edited ones.
