/**
 * Snapshot engine (git instead of Docker commit/save/load).
 *
 * Hard constraint #3: *every self-modification should be recoverable*. Here that is: both
 * workspaces are git repos, a snapshot is a commit + tag recorded in the event log, and a restore
 * is a checkout: instant, diffable (which is literally the self-change UI, user story 5) and
 * kilobytes. It is the first recovery path, not a guarantee on its own: the snapshot store lives
 * in the sandbox-writable workspace, so a self-edit can damage it, and a rewind that fails falls
 * back to reseeding from the app (recovery.ts), which gives up the agent's own harness edits.
 *
 * `healthy` is the flag the watchdog steers by: a snapshot becomes healthy only once the harness
 * has completed a full turn after it, so rewinding always lands on a version that actually ran.
 *
 * Simplification vs the original design: it budgeted a bundled
 * `pnpm` for dependency restore. Both workspaces are dependency-free by design — the harness
 * talks to the substrate over RPC and games are built with the app's bundled esbuild against a
 * vendored three.js — so restore is a pure checkout. {@link SnapshotEngine.restore} still calls
 * the `afterRestore` hook where an install step would go.
