/**
 * The Windows side of `ProcessSandbox` (plan phase 3, W2): sandbox-runtime's Windows backend
 * (srt-win) with Git Bash as the sandbox's shell.
 *
 * How it differs from macOS, and what this module does about it:
 *  - File grants are NTFS ACL entries for the `srt-sandbox` user, applied at `initialize()` for
 *    the whole process; a per-command grant throws. One {@link WindowsSandboxSession} holds the
 *    union of every `ProcessSandbox`'s grants and re-applies it (`reset()` + `initialize()`)
 *    only while no sandboxed command runs, batching every change that queued meanwhile.
 *  - The sandbox user reads nothing in the real user's profile unless granted. Node's realpath
 *    walk and Git stat every directory above a granted folder, so each directory between the
 *    profile and a grant root gets FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES (no inheritance, no listing) as well;
 *    the directories are recorded so the grant can be taken back ({@link ancestorGrants}). Each
 *    grant is set on its folder alone (`windows-folder-ace.ts`): `icacls` walked everything under it.
 *    They are granted after srt-win initializes, every time: its deny stamp puts a deny on each
 *    denied path's parent that replaces the sandbox user's entry there (userData, the parent of
 *    the secrets folder, lost its grant that way), and its reset removes that entry.
 *  - A deny on a path that exists is Genex's own ({@link ownAclEntries}): srt-win's stamp
 *    re-propagates permissions through everything under each denied path's parent, which for
 *    `~\.ssh` is the whole profile and for a game's `.claude` the whole game.
 *  - The environment given to `spawn()` never reaches the child: it starts with the sandbox
 *    user's own. A run's variables travel in an env file in its scratch folder that the command
 *    sources first and deletes ({@link renderEnvFile}).
 *
 * The pure helpers work on Windows paths (`path.win32`) on any platform, so they are tested
 * everywhere; only the session's defaults touch srt-win and the folders' entries.
