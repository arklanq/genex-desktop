/**
 * A fake host for the Unreal Loop's lead (`runUnrealLead`): a third-person game linked to the Unreal
 * project inside its folder, and an editor that answers the Unreal plugin's harness tools from a
 * small model (whether it answers, whether it is dirty or playing, its log, its C++ source; a
 * snapshot holds the level's marks and a restore puts them back). Genex's moments (`hooks.fire`,
 * `checkpoint.take`, `snapshot.restore`) run on a fake bus (`unreal-moment-bus.ts`) that plans the
 * steps from the Unreal plugin's manifest (or one a test hands it, with its tools renamed: `roles`
 * says which plugin tool each one stands for) and answers each step through the plugin's own moment
 * code (`editor-moments.ts`, `hook-answers.ts`) over the model. A test may stall `editor-state`,
 * make a reopen fail, or answer any plugin tool (`answers`) or a whole step (`stepAnswers`) itself.
 * The lead's session is a script of turns: each `engine.delegate` runs the next one, which calls the
 * run tools through the studio's own `director_tool` dispatch (`directorTool`), as the host forwards
 * them, and may wait while the harness watches it. The clock is the test's: a wait moves it and
 * yields once. Every call, step, probe, snapshot and restore lands on one ordered trail.
