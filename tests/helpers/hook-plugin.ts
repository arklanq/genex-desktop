/**
 * A local test plugin, `hk`, that hooks Genex's moments for games holding a `*.hkproj` file (fact
 * `hk-project`). Its harness tools `save`, `tidy`, `flush`, `shot`, `ready`, `check` and `probe` log each
 * call (`{tool, hook}`, what `context.hook` told it) to a file beside the package, never in the game
 * folder a restore would put back (with the game's commit at the time), and answer from a script file the test writes: by `<on>:<tool>`,
 * else by tool; a list answers its entries in turn (the last one repeats); `{throws}` throws, and
 * `{writes}` first writes that file into the game's folder (a kind made).
 * `save` and `tidy` (a step of the run's start, a turn's end and health) need the lock `desk`,
 * whose person-first probe is `probe`. `paint` is its agent tool (it needs the desk too), and
 * `new-desk` its kind tool (it makes a desk game), whose readiness `ready` answers; `hk2`, a second
 * plugin with no hooks, has the agent tool `wave`; `hk3` hooks one checkpoint step, `note`, that
 * needs no lock, for games holding a `*.hklite` file; `hk4` hooks two steps (`first`, `second`) to
 * `tool.before` and one (`last`, which needs its lock `bench`) to `tool.after` around its agent tool
 * `carve`, which asks its card first; `hk5` hooks a run's start (`gate`, which needs its lock `stage`,
 * whose probe is `probe`), each lead turn's start (`curtain`) and its end (`farewell`) for every game. `{hangs: true}` never answers; `{until: <path>}` answers the rest once that file exists.
 * `hk` also declares three observers of desk games: `still` (its tool `shot`), `bad` (`blur`, which
 * hooks nothing) and `held` (`save`, which needs the desk); each call logs what `context.observe`
 * told it.
