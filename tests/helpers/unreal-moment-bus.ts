/**
 * A fake of Genex's hook bus for a harness test host: `hooks.fire`, `checkpoint.take` and
 * `snapshot.restore` answered as the host's `HookService` does, with the steps planned by the
 * shared `hookPlan` over a plugin manifest (the real one, or one a test hands it). Each step is
 * answered by the test host (`step`), a writing moment is held while the chat plans, the steps'
 * locks wait for the person (`probe`, asked every five seconds up to the moment's wait) and a
 * blocking moment stops at its first block (a step that throws blocks; at `health` it is pending).
 * Every step, probe, snapshot and restore is appended to the host's one ordered trail (`log`).
