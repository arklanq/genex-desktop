/**
 * The module contract, integration in waves, and lost registrations: without them parallel loop
 * workers rewrite each other's modules around a shared state object nobody wrote down, the
 * director integrates them one at a time with a health pass each, and a worker can delete cameras
 * other workers' checks look through without anything noticing.
 *
 * The plan carries a contract the harness holds to its shape and commits as docs/MODULE-CONTRACT.md;
 * a loop worker under a plan of several looping parts starts only from a commit that holds it, with
 * its modules stubbed and a seam that leaves the other parts' modules alone. `integrate` takes a
 * wave of workers with one health pass, and running workers take the integration branch once per
 * wave. A camera, demo or probe another facet depends on may not go missing — not in a facet's
 * round, not in a merge.
