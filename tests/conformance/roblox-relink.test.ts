/**
 * After a publish, Genex links the game to the place Roblox now has by itself (`relink.ts`): a first
 * publish handed to the chat leaves a note, and the next look (the panel's status, a moment, a
 * publish call) finds the one Studio whose place is now published under that name or in the Studio
 * the game was bound to, and links it with its ids, with no Use in this game. Nothing is linked
 * without a publish to follow, for two candidates, for a place another game builds in, or once the
 * note is old. Over the fake Mac, with the host keeping links as Genex does.
