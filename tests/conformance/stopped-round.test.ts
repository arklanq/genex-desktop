 * A round the lead stopped (M1.4).

 * The harness stops a builder mid-edit — to fix the starting point, to wrap the run up — and

 * undone: it is grey, it says who stopped it, and it never claims the work was thrown away.
 * One run showed the owner four red "stopped by you" rounds they had had no part in.
