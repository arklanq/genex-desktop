/**
 * A new game's first Unreal chat. The turn that makes the game's Unreal project ends while Unreal
 * still opens it (a first start prepares shaders for minutes); a chat once went quiet there for
 * most of an hour, the builder's "I'll start as soon as the editor is ready" kept by nobody. Now
 * the chat waits on Genex's `health` moment, which the game's plugins answer: it says once why it
 * waits, and the same session goes on by itself once nothing is pending. Before the engine
 * question, each kind on offer carries its plugin's readiness (`kinds[].ready`, `note`), so Unreal
 * is offered honestly; the harness names no plugin's tool for either.
