/**
 * The door — where a launch lands, and what the run promises (M1.7).
 *
 * Two rules are tested here as pure functions, and then pinned in the files that draw them.
 * The opening rule exists because a first launch used to land in the Studio thread — the one
 * chat that cannot build — so the first sentence a new user typed was answered with "this chat
 * never builds; press the folder+". The promise exists because the switch offered "∞ — until
 * the critics are satisfied", which told nobody when to come back, and the first real run
 * was paused by the Claude plan's five-hour window at 105 of 180 minutes.
