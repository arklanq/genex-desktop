/**
 * Claude Code permissions in a game chat, from the host's side: only the session answering a
 * message the person sent in this game's own chat is handed a mode and a way to ask; every other
 * delegation (builders, anything the harness shapes on its own) keeps the sandboxed contract, and
 * a build's lead or the run's coordinator asks from its own seat (lead-sessions-host.test.ts). A question lands in the chat as a pending card and its answer as a
 * settled one; a Stop, the turn's end or a restart withdraws it without anyone's click; and the
 * harness can neither forge the person's chat nor write their questions.
