/**
 * What a builder is told on a project's first message, from the folder's facts; Genex never reads the
 * person's words to decide. A folder with no kind yet is told to pick one: web through
 * `start_web_game`, an engine whose plugin is on through the question card, anything else through
 * `plugins_find`. A folder that has a kind is never asked; each kind gets its own rules, named by
 * path when the folder holds more than one; an Unreal project with the plugin off is told it has no
 * Unreal tools. Every brief opens with who runs it: Genex, the folder, what it holds and what a
 * Genex plugin is.
