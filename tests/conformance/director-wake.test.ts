/**
 * The director's wake loop, without a rig: when the lead is woken and why (wake-schedule.ts),
 * what the message that wakes it says (wake-prompts.ts), what the journal keeps (wake.ts), and
 * the typed lines the run's producers write so the waker never reads English.
 *
 * The lead used to stay inside one long turn — `wait` in a loop and a "continue" prompt whenever
 * the turn ended with time left, which stretched a single session over the whole run. Now it ends its turn after every decision and the studio wakes the same
 * session with a digest when something happens. Every clock here is a number the test chooses.
