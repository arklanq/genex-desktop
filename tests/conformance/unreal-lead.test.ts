/**
 * The Unreal Loop's lead, pinned on a fake host whose `engine.delegate` runs the lead's turns and
 * answers their run tools through the studio's own dispatch: ONE fresh session in the game folder,
 * resumed turn after turn until the run's time is up; the lead's own save points (refused while the
 * game plays, with the new log errors and the hero shots' tone numbers); rewinds, rebuilds and
 * crash restores cold and between turns; a paused run resuming from its journal; a fresh session
 * handed the run when the old one is lost; the cost read from per-turn deltas; and every editor
 * step run by the plugin at Genex's moments, with only the C++ module's tools called by name.
