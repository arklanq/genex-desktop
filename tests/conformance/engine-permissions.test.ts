 * the options a chat's session starts with (its mode, no sandbox, no blanket shell, deny rules
 * at their real absolute paths, on POSIX and on Windows), how Claude Code's question and "always" suggestions travel to
 * the host and the person's answer comes back, and the mode reports and live control the
