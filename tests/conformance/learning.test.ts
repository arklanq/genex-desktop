/**
 * Learning from runs — the studio's memory of one game.
 *
 * The harness already learned two things between runs: skills (skillopt, the blind pairwise
 * gate) and techniques (the recipe library, promoted and retired by check outcomes). Neither
 * remembered a *game*, so the second run on a game paid for the first run's mistakes again:
 * rounds lost to one inherited console error, and nothing anywhere wrote that down.
 *
 * What is tested here: the ledger records a run leaves (judged rounds, stopped rounds, the
 * builders the fork gate refused, the close), the lessons those records add up to, that both
 * briefs carry them the next run, that a check nobody has ever been able to measure is flagged
 * in the catalogue and warned about in the dry run, the one line the morning card gets, and that
 * the skillopt analyst now sees what a director's run actually did. No model runs here: the
 * pure halves are pure, and the rig run is the fake engine.
