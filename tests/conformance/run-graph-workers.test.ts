/**
 * Workers, jobs and the finish check in the Builds graph's model. Every worker a lead starts is one
 * session node on its own row, folded with what the director already wrote about it; a graph that
 * holds a worker's or a job's records is a tree whose lead carries the jobs, and a run's tree ends
 * in the finish check until the run finishes. A chat turn that started workers is a graph of its
 * own, keyed by the turn. Logs without these records fold to exactly the nodes they always did.
