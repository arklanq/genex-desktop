/**
 * Publish handed people the game's public page as `genex.games/world/<slug>`. genex.games moved
 * that page to `genex.games/<slug>` and answers the old form with a permanent redirect, and the
 * Genex CLI prints the new form — but every read of the publish record rebuilt the link from the
 * hosted project in the old form, over the one the CLI printed, so the Publish dialog showed and
 * copied the stale address.
 *
 * The pages Studio derives for a hosted game are the ones genex.games serves: the public page at
 * `<dashboard>/<slug>`, the draft page at `<dashboard>/draft/<slug>`.
