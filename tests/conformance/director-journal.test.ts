/**
 * The director's full journal, without a rig. Everything a run needs to go on lives in the run's
 * journal, not only in the harness's memory: the time the run has worked, which a Resume goes on
 * from instead of restarting the budget or reading the wall clock (journal.ts `loopRunClock`); the
 * record every save writes (loop-run.ts `saveJournal`) — each worker's brief, seam, deadline, rounds
 * and last accepted commit, the defects nobody owns, the plan and its review window, the
 * integration's health, the workers' engine limit, the log and what the lead has heard of it; what
 * a resumed run reads back (`restoreLoopRun`); the first message it opens with, a digest built from
 * that record; and how often it is saved, into a store that keeps every version. And the workers'
 * engine limit, cleared once it lifts. And a finished build its chat reopens (director/reopen.ts):
 * its rewritten journal gives a fresh clock and wake loop, a fork in the game folder as it is now,
 * and the lead's words for the finished build instead of a pause. Every clock here is a number the
 * test chooses.
