/**
 * A job's end wakes the lead. The harness reads a run's job ends from the host's registry
 * (`jobs.list`) after a cursor it keeps, so nothing is told twice or lost; an end the lead caused
 * itself is passed over; an app without `jobs.list` wakes nobody and fails nothing; and a resting
 * director is woken soon by a line that names the job. The run's own use of the cursor is in
 * director-journal.test.ts, the Unreal lead's in unreal-lead.test.ts.
