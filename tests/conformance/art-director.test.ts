/**
 * The art director (loop/ship-review.ts, director/art-direction.ts), without a rig: one absolute
 * look at the whole game — every camera it registered, its eyes, its demos' end frames and its
 * motion — asked "would you ship this as the user's demo today?", with each defect typed to the
 * plan part that owns it. The lead can ask for it (`judge ship=yes`); the studio runs it itself at
 * the finish mark of a timed build, and once for a goal build whose lead idles or finishes with no
 * review on its head. Its defects go to their owners' boards as the director's own checks. It is
 * reported, never a landing veto. Every clock here is a number the test chooses, and the judge is
 * a host that answers what the row needs.
