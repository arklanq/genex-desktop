/**
 * Two subscriptions in one run — through the real core and
 * the real harness child. A director on Claude Code hires workers on Codex and asks Codex to
 * judge: every delegation and every judge call must reach the engine the roles named, with a
 * model that engine knows and a brief in that engine's own tool voice. And when the workers'
 * engine hits its limit, that is the workers' problem, not the director's: the run does not
 * pause, and run_status says which engine is out and for how long.
