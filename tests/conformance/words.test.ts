/**
 * Words — the app's one vocabulary.
 *
 * Two kinds of test live here. The first is ordinary: a harness phrase goes in, the sentence a
 * non-technical owner reads comes out. The second is a gate: the harness's own status lines are
 * read out of `src/harness-seed/loop/*.ts` and every one of them must survive translation
 * without leaking a run id or a commit sha, and no renderer file except `words.ts` may hold a
 * translation of its own. That is what stops the vocabulary drifting back into the panels.
